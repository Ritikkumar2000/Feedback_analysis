"The fact that netflix seriously has the nerve to kick me out of the app because “my tv is not a part of the account household.” For 1. If you don't want the account to be shared, do not create the option to make multiple profiles. For 2. This app is nowhere near good enough for me to WANT to create an entire new account when my brother already pays for it. Most of the shows are crap, they never have anything good and when they do, they take it down. Overall, I'll NEVER use this app again.",Negative
"Inexpensive, syncs seamlessly and quickly with other Apple products, batteries are replaceable. I have one on my dog's collar, one in my car, one on my key ring, and one in my purse.  The Apple brand accessories (e.g., fobs) are silly expensive though, best to buy one of the many knock offs available on Amazon and elsewhere.  Watch out for knock off AirTags on Amazon, some of them look pretty convincing.",Positive with Suggestion
Overall GREAT App but I'm having problems getting in because I got logged out for some reason so if they could give information twice that would be better or just save the password and username but I could just  be stupid right now you don't have to do it but I would like it,Positive with Suggestion
"Very noice! :) I loved it, i got it like a year ago (ish) but I still like it. It works fine, has nice stuff, was accurate to what it showed. The packaging on the little thing where it shows the name was a little sticky though. But still very easy to fix!. It's good to put drinks it, no leaks, comfortable to carry like any other cup its size or any size! Just not light, but still fine to carry. Also one time I was drinking out of it and I left it, it kept the drink (water) cold for 8 HOURS?! Fav cup and it's no.2 in favs. All most very much grateful package. Arrived like 3hrs early :3",Positive

"I am writing this to warn those who wand to bring their dog to fly with themUnited charged $250 for my 20 pound dog to fly with me fro Newark to TampaI spoke withe the rep for United who helped me choose a seat that the approved dog carrier that would fit under the seat in front of meThere was barely enough room for my dog and NO room for my legsThe assigned seat was broken and when I said something to the stewardess she said well if the dog does not fit under the swat in front of you, you will have to vacate the plane!My dog barely fit although the specified carrier by United was usedA little latter I heard the nasty stewardes talking with other employees for United at which she told me I would have to vacate the plansThe couple sitting next to me insisted that the pup was secured under the seat in front of meThere was a long pause and nothing else was saidI will never fly United again",Negative

Felt this was not an up to date 2020 course - useful but a lot of the Google Ads interface/functionality was significantly different to the version the course ran through. Lots of functionality that I could not access (such as Google / Organic keywords info). Felt I still took away learnings for my business but not the same level of other Udemy courses I have completed.,Negative with Suggestion

"It's Apple!! I use the “find me” for my keys, my husbands keys, and our dogs collar.(Just incase she got out unexpected). I had one of the air tags due after 4 years, so easy to replace in Amazon.",Positive
I just started using this app consistently &amp; I'm really liking it to help deal w/ life stressors at the moment.  The only thing I struggle with is I don't find most of the narrators voices calming or relaxing (but great content!).  It would be really nice if there were different options &amp; customers could change to whatever voice they respond to better.  Other then that fantastic &amp; worth the subscription price.,Positive with Suggestion

"As a cancer patient, a friend recommended Calm. It wasn't a good fit for me, but at the end of week's trial, an annual subscription fee was automatically charged. Attempts to switch to monthly were futile. I could cancel, but told I would continue to access the program for the remainder of the year, in essence non-cancellable with no refund. Trial subscriptions can be ideal to test, but this App not having customer support has proved disappointing.",Negative
"I've been a loyal fan of Apple devices for decades, but it's important to understand that the AirTag is NOT a GPS tracker, and therefore may not be the best option for keeping on your pets to find in the event they become lost.  While it's conveniently set up on the Find My network, it works ONLY with Apple devices, and the Find My network range is limited because it relies on other Apple devices in the area to relay the AirTag's location.  So if you're in a rural or remote area with no other or limited Apple devices around, the AirTag will be difficult to locate, if at all.",Negative
"If I could give 0 stars I would. My family has used Netflix for over 7 years but recently with their “password sharing” rules it is no longer worth the money in my opinion. You pay almost $16/month for mediocre shows and movies and if you are a college student living away from home, you're considered no longer a part of the house hold and required to pay $7.99/month on top of the standard cost just to be able to watch it on your tv. The only reason I'd watch is for the 2 actually good tv shows they put out once a year. Save your money and use other platforms that are more worth it.",Negative
Absolute worst airlines and customer support. My bag came out of the carousel completely ruined and destroyed. They offered me a $150 credit or a replacement bag that they provide. Seriously? My brand new away luggage looks like it went through a garbage disposal and all they can offer is $150 credit or some crappy luggage. Customer service is rude and I can't believe they treat and speak to customers this way. Not to mention my suitcase was opened and things were missing,Negative

"Hi my name is Rasmus. My family and I was traveling with united from Germany to Honduras the 16th of March this year. First we get told to pick up our luggage when we get to Houston, but our luggage never shows up, we ask a worker what to do and get told that our luggage will go automatically to our connection flight, that sounds great.. When we get to Honduras surprise surprise NO luggage.. We go talk to a worker from united and we explain how the bag looks like and so on.. She says that it is in Houston, okay no problem we will get it tomorrow then, we expect.. Then next day when we call them it turns out that it's in Germany now, so we have to wait some more days.. Then when it's coming and they bring it to us it's not our luggage, yes it has our tag on it but the tag is loose and the bag don't look anything like what we told them. So after many calls to united here in Honduras and the States we still don't have our luggage and have no idea if they will ever find it.. You can just buy what you need at save the receipt they tell us, why do you think we bring stuff from Europe to Honduras, maybe because you CAN'T find that stuff here. Plus we also bring stuff that means a lot to us that you can't put a price on. And who knows if we ever get money from united to cover the cost..?We offer to sent them a picture of the luggage but they don't want or are able to receive photos.. So now we are just calling every day and listen to the same excuse.. But we will not give up..So I can't recommend to travel with United. Stay away from them if you don't want trouble.",Negative

"Bring back mini player mode please!

"These are some great style NIKE but definitely not what you'd wear for running. They just don't have the necessary bounce in the forefoot to provide adequate cushioning and the heel has barely the reflex to justify these as runners. These are more of a ""Street Style"" casual dress shoes, and here's where they excel, in looks and short term comfort for daily wear. Additionally: Order a Half to Whole Size larger than your normal size.",Negative with Suggestion
"Netflix, by not allowing your customers to use VPNs with your product you are encouraging unsafe practices when using the internet and encouraging long time users who prioritize safety to go elsewhere to stream. 

I know this will hurt your business model and bottom line. 

Wouldn't it be better to use the (Amazon) Prime model and charge a subscription to each additional countries market?",Negative with Suggestion
I think the training is great. I really appreciate that strategy behind the different elements is shared. It helps to understand why you would do one thing over another.,Positive
"I think this is possibly the worst designed product Apple has ever made, in my opinion. I see it as putting form well above function. It was like Apple decided to combine a mouse with a trackpad. In this case, the tracking is done by moving the trackpad around as opposed to using the pad to track. If I remember correctly, someone else on here referred to this mouse as an ergonomic disaster and I have to agree. The sides of this mouse are sharp and pinching with barely anything to grab on to. It appears the mouse was not designed with a consideration for where to put thumbs and any other fingers people might need to use to hold on to a mouse, or at least a spot where they can rest those fingers so they're not in the way. What's more, if my thumb drops as it is inclined to do due to gravity and because it is in pursuit of a stronger grip then my thumb gets pinched between the silver base and the white top part of the mouse that functions like a giant mouse button. It's like my thumb is in the way of this mouse doing what it wants to do. On the opposite side, my little finger gets dragged and pushed around on the mousepad as it has no place to go.To make matters worse, the white touch surface top does not feel secure. It rocks sideways ever so slightly. That loose top gets tiring after a while and I think it may be in part responsible for my struggles getting the mouse to start selecting text on the letter that I want it to start selecting on.The flat white surface of the mouse, the mini trackpad that doesn't track, is good for quick scrolling but there's a catch, I find it gets tiring after a while because my pointer finger is repeatedly hitting and gliding over a hard surface. Sometimes my fingernail scrapes along the surface as well. It was after my fingernail got caught scraping the top of the mouse while scrolling one day that led me to say to myself enough, I'm not using this anymore. In addition to the scrolling getting tired after a while, my index finger does drift over to the middle of the mouse. Having used ergonomic mice, I now believe that the flat shape is in part responsible because there is so little for my hand to grip on to. The drifting leads left clicks to turn into right clicks. It is annoying when I occasionally click on something expecting to select it or what not, only to see the context menu pop up instead. I also got this mouse for my mother to use and her finger drifts over to the right so often that I decided to turn off the right click function to help her out. She doesn't use the right click button so she isn't missing anything but others might have use for the right click button. Despite that, the scrolling feature gets in her way still and she uses that. Another issue both of us have with scrolling, and this is one of the most annoying things about this mouse, is that we often, her more than me I think, find ourselves scrolling sideways while scrolling down or up when we just want to scroll down or up. I've never had that issue on mice with scroll wheels, or any other mouse for that matter. There'd be times when I'd have what I'm looking at lined up just right and then when I scroll, I can't scroll down or up in a straight line with out it moving sideways at some point. Another annoying thing about the touch surface of the mouse is that occasionally I'll brush it with my finger when I'm in the process of putting my hand back on to the mouse after typing on the keyboard. That leads to something happening that I didn't want which needs to then be corrected.One of the bonuses of the touch surface is that it opens the door for tapping and swiping, adding functionality without the need for buttons. I never got comfortable with swiping on a mouse, while I just used tapping in order to use Mission Control. The way it is set up requires a double two-finger tap on the touch surface but what feels like half the time, I don't tap the top of the mouse right and I have to do it again until I get Mission Control to work. That issue didn't go away over time with practice. Tapping, for me, is not a replacement for a third button on a traditional mouse.Another negative, and this one is talked about a lot, is that the lightning port used for recharging is on the underside of the mouse which means in order to recharge the mouse it has to be on its side or laying down with its belly up. That of course means you can't recharge the mouse and use it at the same time.To make matters worse, there aren't many positives I find with this mouse. It is Apple's mouse, for one, and for that you are assured lasting compatibility with Macs. I've had multiple experiences where Logitech mice all of a sudden don't work properly or are not compatible after an update or with a new Mac. Two, the battery lasts a good amount of time. Maybe up to three months on a single charge. That seems good to me. However, I did encounter an issue when I recharged the mouse the first time. Despite following the directions on how to check when the mouse is fully charged, when I went to use it again the following morning I noticed that the charge was at 74%. It was at 12% before I recharged it the night before and said it was at 100% when I unplugged it. I had to recharge it a second time in order to get it up to 100%. Hopefully, that was just a one time issue. The third positive is that the mouse is lightweight. I prefer lightweight mice but in this case, it doesn't make up for the drawbacks. The fourth positive is that its shape and weight makes it easy to fit in a bag or in a pocket.In the end, the positives do not come close to outweighing its negatives for me. The key phrase is, ""for me,"" as there are people out there that prefer tapping and swiping and smaller mice. From my experience, seeing my mother's struggles and reading other reviews, this mouse is simply not for everyone and I don't fully understand why Apple designed it the way they did. Too much form over function to me. I would take a corded mouse over this one if I had to. Unless you prefer mice like the Apple Magic Mouse as opposed to a traditional style mouse with scroll wheels and a mouse like shape, I'd recommend trying out other mice first before paying for this one. Chances are you'll find something that's more comfortable and less frustrating to use for less money. But if you are willing to spend a bit more. Then there are mice out there like the Logitech MX Master which are designed to be more comfortable, may even feel like they are better made than the Magic Mouse, while having more features and capabilities.",Negative with Suggestion

"They cancelled my flight from Boston to London Heathrow on 21st August, 2023 the day of my departure and was asked to re-book. As I had checked out of my holiday accommodation I was asked to make my way to the airport to get vouchers for holiday Inn Express Hotel Boston. When I got to the airport the staff were not interested and they said that it wasn't their responsibility but because I had screenshots of all the correspondence they then gave me Hotel and meal vouchers. When I got to the hotel I was asked for details of my credit/visa card which I reluctantly gave. To cut the long story short I believe United Airlines did cancel all the vouchers and the hotel ended up charging my card. Only discovered that when I got back home to England,  tried in vain to recover my money from the hotel. Spent days phoning the hotel bearing in mind our time difference until I managed to speak to the manager who then referred me back to the airline.  Managed to lodge my claim but they keep playing mind game, send this and that which I have already supplied. Will never use that airline again. Nasty experience from going and back.",Negative

How ever I have not been able to find some of my favorite shows that I just took a little break from and so far I'm going towards the conclusion that they took it off Netflix, so pls stop taking shows off of Netflix because some of the shows don't have the full episodes on YouTube and then some of the shows are in apps that I don't have or have to pay for. If you do travel a lot though or even if you just want to watch Netflix a lot like me then this is a great app for you.

I was shocked at how I was spoken to as a customer, they interrupted, spoke to me in a sarcastic/degrading manner and refusal to connect me to someone else. I have been trying to get my travel voucher (which was provided to me as inactive) reissued for the past month. I have spent 10 hours + on calls to United and everytime I am given different information. The company do not have a call log (so they say) and are unable to transfer me to the last person I spoke to. We even requested a call back, to which we did not receive. The fact that they cannot tell us where our money is since “they do not have the records” is frankly ridiculous. I want my money back or the voucher which was issued. The fact that a company this size are keeping my money is criminal.",Negative

"Aveeno Baby Daily Moisture Gentle Bath Wash & Shampoo has been a game-changer in our daily baby care routine. As a parent, I've tried my fair share of baby washes, but this one stands out for all the right reasons.First of all, the formula is incredibly gentle, which is a top priority when it comes to my baby's delicate skin and hair. It lathers up nicely and cleans thoroughly without causing any irritation or dryness. I love that it's tear-free, so bath time is a joyous, tearless experience for my little one.The fact that this product is both a bath wash and shampoo in one bottle is a real convenience. It simplifies our bath time routine, and I don't have to juggle multiple products. It also means fewer products cluttering up the bathroom.The natural oat extract in the formula is a standout feature. It helps to soothe and nourish my baby's skin, leaving it feeling soft and moisturized. Even during dry winter months, we haven't experienced any dryness or flakiness.The gentle fragrance is a subtle delight. It's not overpowering, which is perfect for a baby product. It leaves my baby smelling fresh without being overwhelming.The packaging is practical with a flip-top cap, making it easy to dispense the right amount of product without any mess. Plus, it's a decent-sized bottle that lasts for a while, so it's a good value for the price.In summary, Aveeno Baby Daily Moisture Gentle Bath Wash & Shampoo has earned a permanent spot in our bathroom. It's a reliable, gentle, and convenient product that takes care of my baby's skin and hair with love and care. I can't recommend it enough to fellow parents – it's simply fantastic!",Positive
Household makes no sense. You have to pay extra just for a “family” plan to do what its supposed to do. Not every family shares the same wifi 24/7. Basically they wanted to screw over half of their users just to make an extra buck.,Negative

"The Calm app has truly transformed my daily routine. It's my go-to for finding peace and relaxation amidst life's chaos. The guided meditations and sleep stories are a game-changer for my sleep quality. The soothing sounds and beautiful visuals transport me to a serene place whenever I need it. I appreciate the variety of content, from mindfulness exercises to stress relief techniques. Calm has become an essential part of my self-care journey, and I couldn't recommend it more highly. Thank you for creating this oasis of tranquility in my busy life!",Positive

Not only that, it is very aesthectically pleaasing to the eye. This app is easy to navigate through. I also like that this app is availavle for people of all ages to use. The app is a bit pricey, but the free portion of the app is enough to use if you do not want to pay for it. I suggest using the 7-day free trial to see if you want to pay for it, or if you just want to stick with the free app.",Positive

"I bought this because I was tired of my other $20 dollar mouse not working great with the Mac, between the terrible scrolling quality and the connectivity issues, I just decided to make the great plunge and get the Magic Mouse. But, I am so happy I did, it works amazing. The agronomics of it could be better, but I don't necessarily mind because I am young. But the scrolling works great, it feels like using the trackpad on the Mac, but in a mouse form. I recently have done some video editing for a trip I took and I could not imagine using another mouse for that just because the Magic Mouse allows you not only to scroll up and down, but side to side like a trackpad. Some people complain about the charging method, but for me, I have a widget on my desktop that shows the battery percentage of my devices and when I see the mouse is low, when I go to take a break or log off for the day, I plug it in, no big deal. Would buy again, 100%. My only true complaint with the mouse is that it still only charge via lightening port and not USB-C, hopefully they fix that soon!",Positive with Suggestion

"First off, I would like to say everyone is different and how this app effects them may vary. In my experience though it has helped me so much with my anxiety. It's helped me sleep better and just feel much better about myself. I was struggling the last couple months with anxiety and it was causing me panic attacks and I started to get full blown insomnia. For two weeks I had totaled at 8 and a half hours of sleep the whole week (not one night). My cousin gifted me a yearly subscription for this app and genuinely have never been more grateful. If you have the resources to spend on this app and you really need it, I would definitely recommend giving it a chance. If you don't have the money I'm not sure what the free version is like but it may be good. And a word of advice, also use resources outside the app for help as well! You got this and stay strong!",Positive

We've been using this Aveeno Baby Wash for two years now. We like it because it has a soft smell and can be used as both a shampoo and as a body wash.

We recommend!,Positive

"The nice thing about Apple products is how easily they work with their other devices.  Connecting this Magic Mouse to my MacBook was seamless and took less than a minute.  This replaced a previous generation Magic Mouse (with AA batteries) that worked for 9 years until it died - not bad these days.  There's only two things I'd like to see Apple change on the generation of the Magic Mouse:#1 - Can we PLEASE stop using the old Lightning ports?  This mouse uses one for recharging (and it comes with a Lightning cable).  But the trend for the last couple of years has been to phase out the Lightning ports and cables in favor of USB-C.  I'd like to not have to have specific cables for specific devices any more.#2 - For some reason (likely aesthetics), the charging port is on the bottom of the Magic Mouse.  This, of course, renders the mouse useless when charging.  Apple need to take a cue from Logitech which places their charging port (a USB-C) on the front of their rechargeable mouses (mice?) so you can still use those while they refuel.  This charging port location is a rare bad design from Apple.",Positive with Suggestion

They only gave me $277.40 for my 27074 miles from my account. So you see the miles and the BS they sell you to use their credit card and get miles does not worth the same. Is just a scam as all of the mile programs from all airlines. Is better to get a credit card that gives you cash back instead of using this scams from the airlines. You have been warned!",Negative

"My sister and I are living at two different colleges, and our parents are divorced so we have 2 homes. A family of 4 now has to spend $52 a month to each watch Netflix. FIFTY TWO DOLLARS A MONTH ARE YOU FOR REAL???? You'll be lucky if you have a company at all in 10 years time you moronic piece of capitalism trash. Price breakdown: Premium account allows 2 additional members that's 3 people for $36, and 1 more standard account is $16 = $52 for 4 people). Netflix Managment I wish each of you nothing but pain, hardship, and misery for years to come. - Love, Sydney",Negative
"I purchased this after a frantic day of searching for my Kindle. It easily linked to my iPhone's Find My app. Now, I can see the location of and play a tone to help me locate my precious Kindle.",Positive
"Rude, passive aggressive attitudes from the flight attendants. Infantilized by male flight attendant. No adult traveling with children cares to be spoken to as if they are ignorant, incompetent especially not by persons who are supposed to be providing a service. We don't work for you WE are the customer. Horrible customer service. My minor child was targeted, searched and interrogated at one of the gates prior to boarding. Your airline and poorly rated and there are no shortage of reasons why.",Negative
"Another great LEGO product! The set was a great price for the number of LEGO pieces included, and I always love the yellow bins for decorating and organizing our LEGO space.The variety of pieces was great, and the instruction book included many different builds (scooter, camera, bear, house, etc.).",Positive

"when I booked my flight a 2 month in advance the ticket was 3000.00 I check it a few days ago and now it is half the price I checked it because  I got an email say they gate we will arrive to has construction and will be late meaning I will miss my connecting flight. I ask If I can get a refund or credit and the agent stated its against our policy. Alaska airlines always refunds you if the fair drops in price. This is only the 2nd time I've wrote a review!! what ever happened to customer care? I would like to write more, but I can't",Negative with Suggestion
"I asked ChatGPT for the best hair products, specifically shampoos for children, and it recommended this brand. I read the reviews and decided to try it. It doesn't cause any irritation for my child and cleans the hair well. I like it and will buy more when this one runs out.",Positive
Hi I'm Ellie and I have a very hard time getting a good amount of sleep that's why I use kids stories on calm. Every time I can't go to sleep I listen to a story and fall asleep almost immediately. I also sometimes use the breath or the daily move. I use the breath because it helps me relax and calm down. I use that daily move cus it helps my move stretch and it makes me feel tired. My favorite part about calm is the kids stories. My favorite story is raggedy an stories. I like that story because it reminds me of just being calm you know. Anyway this is why I use calm and I think if you have any trouble with breathing falling to sleep exercise and much more. Calm has it. 😊,Positive
This course really helped simplify the AdWords framework and campaign creation process for me. I think I got a lot out of it considering the super cheap price tag. The only critiques I have are that at times it's repetitive and moves very quickly. Constantly had to pause to take notes. Great resource for fellow AdWords beginners though!,Positive with Suggestion

Best product for baby..,Positive
This course is as advertised and I've found it to be very informative for beginners. Thanks for breaking all the topics into bite-sized lessons that are easy to understand and your links are very thoughtful.,Positive
"They canceled my flight on June 18, 2023, due to their mechanical problem, and they asked us to pay for the hotel and meals ourselves first without any arrangements for that night. They said passengers can submit it to their website and be reimbursed later. They are a liar and never respond to your request. When you contact them, they will ask you to submit to many different departments and say your money cannot be refunded. Hate this airline so much, just feel like they are a thief and have stolen money and are lying to me!!! It is the worst experience I had with an airline!!!",Negative
"I bought two Google AdWords courses and this one is WAY better. There are relevant slides, great information and we get a walkthrough of someone's ad account for some first hand experience or to follow along on your own. Perfect.",Positive
"I advise you to use it I showed it to my husband, we bought them. My baby's skin is very fresh and they smell  are simple.",Positive
I'm just getting into Adwords and found this course very useful in getting my first campaign up and running. Corey is insightful and concise. Some material probably goes further than a normal 'beginners' course which is a huge plus. Thank you!,Positive
"I hate Netflix now, they keep removing actual good movies and shows I wanted to show my friend The Breakfast Club and Netflix removed it. There aren't really any good shows or movies I do still watch some good ones (I recommend Kim's Convenience) but I really wish they kept old movies and shows on there, Netflix is garbage now.",Negative with Suggestion
"If I could drop zero stars, I would. Customer service people have zero customer service skills, they are rude, the management is even more rude than the CS, they will change flight times on you with no notification and then blame you for not knowing. They will admittedly send flights out early without all passengers to make everyone else happy because they would prefer to deal with a single unhappy customer if it makes everyone else happy on the flight. I' supposed to be in California right now holding my son and instead I will be sitting in this dump all night long until he's in bed. Why? So united Airlines can make a plane full of people happy at my expense.Do not fly with this airline, do not fly with this airline, DO NOT FLY WITH THIS AIRLINE!",Negative
"We bought two of these because our main lego bucket was looking a little sad. I thought these would be great but I underestimated the quantity. We have 4 kids and two adults who all love lego and we really need a larger refill option of extra pieces. That being said, it came with a ton of color variety and size/shape options. Very pleased...just need more.",Positive with Suggestion
"If you are a music producer, video editor, etc who uses a Mac, Get this! I cant explain how much it has improved my workflow using Logic Pro and Davinci Resolve. The battery life is actually insane as well, from the time of purchase to now I have not had to charge the mouse once so this perfectly makes up for the awkward position it has to be in while charging (which Ive never had to do yet; battery life 73%). Now Im not sure about other computers but I would absolutely vouch for this thing for anyone who uses Mac and needs to upgrade their workflow. The scrolling is elegant and better than any other mouse Ive ever used (specifically for Mac softwares); for example in Logic Pro I can finally scroll sideways instead of have to keep clicking back where I want to be while doing any editing/recording etc. This thing is a game changer. Not very ergonomic as other people said but its more subjective than not Id say, for me I dont mind the design at all and havent experienced any cramps or anything. That being said I wouldnt recommend for gaming but most certainly for editing/digital workflows on any Mac software.",Positive

"I wanted a reliable insurlated tumber when I'm on the go! My great niece( a teen no doubt) told the the Stanly Quecher was all the rage now and I shoud ""get with it"".( I had an old time plastic one. Well, I I live the weather was 24 degrees when a friend and I ventured out to run some errands. I packed my Stanley Quencer with green tea and lemon. My friend had a different type.  After three hours we went to sit down in a shopping  mall.She opened her tea and found lukewarm. I put the insulated straw in my Stanley Quencher and tea was still hot, not steaming but a pleasurable tempature to drink. I', ordering one for my friend. Suffice it to say, my teen age niece was pleased when she saw tumbeler on the kitchen table ! I highly recommended this product and they come in beautiful colors, but be conservative I like the black.!",Positive
My kids love them I have no complaints! ❤️ also comes with two booklets with piece by piece how to build some things.,Positive
Corey's course is vey well organized and presented. Udemy is becoming very saturated with content of people not actually succeeding in what they teach. You can clearly tell Corey has great experience in this field. Don't be on the fence about taking this course. Get it and you'll be glad you did. Thank you for the valuable content Corey.,Positive
"Great and straight to the point ,easy to follow along and the instructor encourages questions. The quality of the sound and sometimes when you complete a section it doesn't show up so when you complete the course you don't get your completion certificate . But that's just nit picking the course is grate and that's the most important bit. I would take another course from this instructor. Alan Kelly",Positive with Suggestion
"I used it for about 10 months since last March. One day, the part below the handle came off, and a few days later, the handle completely detached. I tried fixing it with epoxy, but it didn't work. Luckily, it was covered under warranty. After contacting Stanley, I received a new bottle within a week. However, they mentioned that the exact same color wasn't available, so they sent a similar one. Still, I'm satisfied!",Positive
"We have not even taken off yet and already our worst experience. For a change we thought we would book a direct UK to Newark instead of via London. Paid for family of 4 sitting together, last minute aircraft change pushed us to individual seats. Had to pay £600 online to take (last) new seats of 2 and 2. We are not being refunded apparently as we should have waited to do this at airport. The aircraft makes Ryan air look like business class. Old, dirty and extremely crammed. Including economy plus. Cannot believe we paid so much for crummy expensive flights and experince. 5 star prices for 1 star offering. Never again even if flights were free. On the plus side the cabin crew seem lovely.",Negative
Easy to follow high level overview of AdWords. He hits the main concepts without getting lost in the details.,Positive
"I love my Stanley! I'll admit, I jumped on the Stanley bandwagon but I am not looking back and will buy another in a different color eventually - they are pricy after all. They aren't leak proof at all so be careful about it tipping over. However, they do make lids that are leak proof so you can always order one of those as well. I have had mine for several months now and it's held up nicely. It's nice and comfortable to hold and truly keeps my drinks ice cold for hours, even overnight. If you're looking for a cute and trendy tumbler, get your hands on a Stanley.",Positive with Suggestion
"I recently purchased the AirTag, and I must say, it has been incredibly useful! As someone who tends to misplace things often, this little device has saved me so much time and stress. Setting it up was a breeze—just attach it to your items, and you're good to go.The precision of the location tracking is impressive, and I love how it integrates seamlessly with my iPhone. I can easily check the location of my keys, bag, or even my pet on the Find My app. The sound feature is helpful too—it's easy to hear when you're in a pinch and need to locate something quickly.What I love most is the peace of mind it provides. Whether you're traveling or just moving around at home, you can rest assured knowing that your things are within reach. Definitely worth the investment for anyone looking to stay organized and reduce those “Where did I leave it?” moments.Highly recommend!",Positive
Great toy for boy or girl.this is going to be a Christmas gift for my great grandson who is 5 a and 1/2 years old.,Positive
"Apple AirTag. Keep track of and find your key: words with my apple phone ap. Convenient, easy, low profile.",Positive
Excellent for car keys!!! That's my primary use for these since everyone in the house drives out cars interchangeably and the keys don't always find their way back to their place of origin. These are fantastic.,Positive
It gives you a great introduction of adwords and how to handle it. I'm sure that everyone who needs to understand adwords  need to take this course,Positive

"Absolutes shambles. Flew out 10th Dec to Newark, airport process on the way to Newark fine, got on the plane hour delay in setting off- fine we can cope with this. 15th Dec to fly home, on the plane for over 2hours, they decide to announce ""mechanical fault"", we will fix it on the plane they said, then they tell us to deplane, then announce the flight is cancelled ""if you could all quickly make your way to alternative gate we have found a back up flight"" - ABSOLUTE OUTRIGHT LIE. 3 hours we wait at this gate, (having already been in the airport over 10 hours might i add). Customer service assistants whispering amongst themselves, telling us lies ""oh its just being cleaned at a different terminal then will make its way to us"" - again LIE. We then had to hear from another angry customer ""your flight has been cancelled"", they didnt even bother to tell us ourselves. 50% of the approx 250 of us received a text to rebook flights and have hotel for night - we were not one of these lucky recipients. we tried united airlines customer service - USELESS. phoned TUI emergency helpline who we booked with ""its unite airlines responsibility we dont have back up aeroplanes"", BRILLIANT. after several hours of being sat at the infamous gate with the infamous plane, we managed to speak with a united airlines representative, she couldnt understand why our text had not been sent, however managed to get us into a hotel in New Jersey- yet another 45 minutes of travelling. We rebooked our flights for 10pm - (bare in mind this was already 4am). *Also to add, a mother and daughter we met at the airport, were not even allocated a hotel, they were provided with x2 sun loungers in the middle of Newark airport to sleep for over 18 hours- i cannot even begin to imagine how they felt. This is an example of anothers experience. Spoke to customer service online, and back in Newark airport next day (having to pay for our own transfer back to the airport which is 60 dollars) - added ourselves to standby flights for 1845pm and 2015pm, managed to up to 9pm flight as confirmed. asked what would happen to our luggage should we manage to board a standby ""oh dont worry it is coded to board the specific flight your on"". no contact that we had been allocated a seat for 2015pm flight, we board our flight - 1 hour delayed, and the plane returns to gate so someones luggage can be taken off - SHAMBLES. we arrive in Heathrow after 37 hours travelling, OUR LUGGAGE IS IN NEWARK. what a surprise. we fill out incident form with their representatives, apparently its our fault for not boarding the right flight- anyone to blame but themselves. It is what it is, we just want our luggage not an argument with another incompetent worker. its now 18/12/22, we should have been home 16/12/22 friday lunchtime, we got home 17/12/22 5pm with no luggage. We have spent the last 12 hours trying to find our luggage and trying to get through to a real person at united airlines. The quest continues as of 18/12/22 1359hrs, still no luggage, still no real person to speak to. update 20/12/22 still no luggage, spent over 3.5 hours on live chat and phone calls last night, 1 advisor told us our luggage was out for delivery in UK, another told us the luggage was still in Newark and another told us it was in Heathrow???? USLESS. Was told to call Groundcare Solutions. Groundcare solutions is not a company it went bust, Eagle Aviation is now the luggage company, we were told our luggage would be delivered 20/12/22, it hasnt. Now been told 22/12/22, that will make it a total of 6 days late.  Moral of this long review story is- AVOID THIS AIRLINE AT ANY COST. We booked our package through TUI, so they are due a swift complaint and some stern advice not to associate themselves with such a shambolic airline. PLEASE AVOID FOR YOUR OWN SAFETY. If we could give -5 stars we would.",Negative

"I recently got the Apple AirTag for my pup, and it's been a total game changer! It's super easy to attach to her collar, and the setup was quick and straightforward through the Find My app. Now, I can always track her location with just a few taps on my phone—whether she's in the backyard or on a walk. The precision is surprisingly spot-on, and I love how it gives me peace of mind knowing I can locate her if she ever gets out of sight. The battery life is great, and the AirTag is small and lightweight, so it doesn't bother her at all. If you're looking for a reliable way to keep tabs on your furry friend, I highly recommend this!
