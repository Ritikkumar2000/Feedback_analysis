I've been buying this exact sneaker for years in most of its color choices. I really like them and to order on line is easy because I know exactly what I'm getting from size fitment to quality. Like some I pull the original insole out right away and add one that has a bit more arch support and away I go. I know I'll have this shoe for a couple years to rotate out with the other color choices I already have. Clearly the price and availability has turned into a real downer! Can't just run to a shoe store to buy anymore and the price has doubled from years past!. Might have to move on someday!.,Negative
Great mouse.  It's smooth and works really well.  I just wish I could figure out the scroll.,Positive with Suggestion
"Love, love, love this thing. The 30 oz. size should be the standard Stanley cup, because honestly the 40 ounces one is just so dang heavy when it's full. Honestly, I have that size for work, because I can't refill it all day like when I'm home. But for the weekend, and on the go- this is the perfect size and I LOVE this color because not a lot of people seem to have it, and that makes me happy...lol",Positive with Suggestion
"I asked ChatGPT for the best hair products, specifically shampoos for children, and it recommended this brand. I read the reviews and decided to try it. It doesn't cause any irritation for my child and cleans the hair well. I like it and will buy more when this one runs out.",Positive

Flights were late into Newark with United (their fault) do we missed connecting flight to London. No one from United around to help so had to go to baggage services ? Queued for 2 Hrs only got help after complaining it's now 1am with 2 kids. Couldn't provide hotel at airport so agreed we'd be compensated it we booked and paid ourselves. Now won't pay compensation for the hotel. Awful customer service,Negative
Not a bad walkthrough of all the major elements of a PPC campaign. The real-world examples really help to paint a picture.,Positive

"I recently got my hands on the Apple Magic Mouse, and it has been a revelation! Here's why it deserves all five stars:Sleek Design: True to Apple's signature style, the Magic Mouse is a minimalist's dream. Its white, glossy finish is not just a visual treat but also complements my Mac and iPad perfectly.Seamless Connectivity: The Bluetooth connection is flawless. Pairing it with my devices took mere seconds, and the connection remains stable, ensuring uninterrupted productivity.Rechargeable Convenience: The built-in rechargeable battery is a huge plus. It charges quickly and lasts for weeks, eliminating the hassle and expense of constantly replacing batteries.Multi-Touch Surface: This feature is an absolute game-changer. The Multi-Touch surface allows for intuitive gestures like swiping between web pages and scrolling through documents. It makes navigation smooth and effortless, enhancing my overall workflow.Comfort and Precision: Despite its slim profile, the Magic Mouse is surprisingly comfortable to use for extended periods. The precision of the cursor movement is exceptional, making tasks like photo editing and graphic design a breeze.Delivered on April 30, 2024, near the front door or porch, my package arrived in acceptable used condition, but it functions like new. For $44.10, it was an incredible deal! Though the return window closed on May 16, 2024, I have no regrets.In summary, the Apple Magic Mouse is a perfect blend of style and functionality. Whether you're a professional or a casual user, this mouse is bound to elevate your computing experience. Highly recommended!",Positive

"The Apple AirTag is a useful and straightforward solution for keeping track of my belongings. Setting it up was quick and simple—just a tap to connect with my iPhone, and I was good to go. Its sleek and compact design makes it easy to attach to items like keys, bags, or even my wallet.The location tracking is precise, and the Find My app provides a clear view of the item's location. When I need to locate something nearby, the Precision Finding feature is especially helpful. It uses haptic feedback and on-screen directions to guide me to the exact spot. The sound the AirTag emits is also loud enough to hear from a distance, which makes it easier to find items when they're buried or hidden.The battery life is impressive, and the AirTag uses a replaceable CR2032 coin cell battery, so there's no need to replace the whole device when the battery runs low. It's also water and dust-resistant, which adds to its durability for everyday use.While the AirTag works well for finding nearby items, if it's far out of Bluetooth range, it depends on the broader Apple network to help locate it, which works most of the time but isn't quite as immediate as I'd prefer in some situations.Satisfaction with Packaging: The packaging was secure, and the setup was straightforward without any issues.Likelihood of Recommending: I would recommend the AirTag to anyone who wants an easy, reliable way to track their belongings.Price Reasonableness: The price is on the higher side for a small tracker, but the quality and seamless integration with the Apple ecosystem make it a worthwhile investment.",Positive with Suggestion

"I am 1k With United and was 1st class.I was a few minutes late to my gate that was still boarding.  I got in line with the others.

"We booked a flight for Cozumel leaving NWA on 05/09/23 at 6:45 am.   We received a text 05/08/23 at 9:50 pm almost 9 hours prior to our flight of possibly storms.  Unreal.   We spent several hours trying to get everything rebooked which we did for the following morning for a 6:45 am departure. Our 2nd attempt to fly out the following morning we woke up at 3:30 am to a text stating our Houston connection was delayed 1 hour and 15 minutes due to mechanical issues and our replacement plane would arrive from Mexico. While waiting to board our first flight in NWA and the agent stated our NWA plane is now delayed around 30 minutes.  We finally board and arrive in Houston, the replacement plane arrives, we were told it is now delayed due to mechanical issues.  We had over a two hour delay here. All this on top of canceling our flight from the day before which did not have storms anywhere around us.  When we did fly out we had storms we flew into and out of in Houston.  We lost an entire day at our resort as well as stress and time getting everything resolved.  We will never fly United again.   One last thing the website said we could not bring a normal sized carry on in the plane.  It had to be something size wise like a 12 inch purse.  If we tried to bring a normal sized carry on we'd be charged $35 to check it at the gate.  When we arrived we saw others who had the larger carry on's and were allowed to board with them.  The agent said the plane had  enough room for 25 regular size carry on bags.",Negative

I have been on Netflix for a long time, I have seen many updates go by and let me just say, All these updates are bad. I just want to watch Netflix on the go but I cannot because we can't download anything anymore which makes Netflix worthless. And the worse part is there are starting to be adds now. Before all these modern updates Netflix used to be great now we can't download anything and there are adds even though paying for even one subscription is expensive and we don't even get the luxuries we used to have.

"There are a lot of types of products we don't order off of Amazon because they are fake or not great products in our personal experience. I saw this Stanley cup in pink (which I've looked for for 2 years & never have seen it in stock) & it was also on sale when I got it so I thought it was probably a fake one or had a defect, but to my surprise it's a real Stanley & it's so much cheaper than the ones my sister got my nieces for Christmas in the same color… it was almost half of what she paid.

"My son is ADHD and ODD. He struggles with focus and following directions / listening to anyone speaking with authority.Legos have been a major tool we have used to teach following directions in a non-abrasive way. They also allow him to not only follow directions and feel proud of what he accomplished but the opportunities are endless. He can build something specific or create something new.He cannot and will not sit still for ANYTHING else, but Legos keep him occupied long enough for me to actually get things done while also helping him learn and use his imagination.The cute container is also a plus. We have these on display all over his Lego themed playroom and he is even doing them with his little brother now. We keep adding new colors and sets to the collection. Some stay built on display, others get built over and over again. Great for all ages (after they stop putting everything in their mouth, the pieces are definitely a choking hazard)",Positive
"As a cancer patient, a friend recommended Calm. It wasn't a good fit for me, but at the end of week's trial, an annual subscription fee was automatically charged.

I originally purchased AirTags to place in all of my family's luggage. Airlines are always misplacing luggage and using an AirTag helps with locating them. I recently purchased a dog collar that has a place for an AirTag. My puppy has gotten loose and we added an airTag to the collar. You will be alerted when the battery needs to be changed (after about a year). Easy to purchase batteries on Amazon. Easy to install.  Everyone needs airtags.,Positive

Subsequently, they lost the bag, which is common for United Airlines. I filed a claim end of December 2022. In January/February time, when I followed up with my claim, they lied to me saying that the bag had been found and returned to me. Which it had not. Once I got that cleared up, they confirmed that I would get reimbursed for the cost of my lost items. This was meant to be paid in May - which it did not. I have been chasing since. I finally called them today, and again, they lied saying that the money should have gone into my account in July. Which, I have proof that it did not.

The Bluetooth connectivity is flawless, and the battery life is incredible, lasting weeks on a single charge.One downside? The charging port placement on the bottom means you can't use it while charging—but with such a long battery life, I rarely find it to be an issue.If you're a Mac user looking for a premium, smooth, and intuitive experience, the Apple Magic Mouse is well worth it.

"My entire family decided to go to Florida this coming May 2023. I booked this flight in September 2022 for myself only, I am not going the whole entire time that everyone else is. I have 2 dogs that I have never been separated from and I have anxiety about them. My friend was going to stay at my house and now due to her husband's medical condition has to cancel on me. When I booked this flight, I spelled my entire name out for the agent, I also asked her if this was refundable (just because of any emergency that I might have to cancel the trip, little did I know at the time this would actually happen) and she said yes it is refundable. I get my confirmation of the ticket in my email and my first name and last name has errors in it. I know from experience working on the phone that a lot of letters sound the same so that is why i always spell out my full name. So I go on the computer on their website and ""chat"" with a live representative.  She claimed she fixed it, I asked her to resend the confirmation, she would not.  I asked her when i get to the airport will I have a problem with the paper copy and email that I have with the wrong name on it. She told me no it is corrected.  so time goes by until this month, January 2023. I find out my friend isn't able to come up, I am in a panic. I call the customer service again to cancel the ticket.  I am told that it is a non refundable ticket. Then when he was asking me to confirm my name and I was spelling it for him, he said it was wrong. I saw red. I told him everything that had happened, he kept apologizing that she told me it was refundable and about my name. He told me that he will fix my name but it is another additional $99 charge to do this. I said this isn't my fault I spelled my name for her letter by letter using a name to clarify it, like D for dog. I should have never gotten it fixed but I went ahead and did it.  Well I am looking for boarding for my dogs and I am disgusted with what I am finding. so I call back 2 or 3 days later and talk to another agent. I again asked if I could get a refund and he said unfortunately no.  I asked if i could upgrade my seat to a refundable one for another $100, and again he said unfortunately I cannot. then I told him the story about the name change and I feel that I should not have been charged that $99 for the change since I did not enter my name into the computer, I spelled it out for that agent. He totally agreed and told me he was going to send an email to his superior, he could see who took the initial call. he also said he was going to carbon copy me on the email.  I am still waiting for that email to come through to me. I guess that was never done either, because I haven't heard a word from United from anyone. all of this was even before I even had a chance to stop foot on the plane. I have decided that I probably am not going to go on this trip, I am waiting for a call back from one more kennel and I don't have high hopes about that one either. So they won't refund my money because of an incompetent agent who you could barely understand to begin with. So I guess they expect me to eat the $500 loss. if I could rate United airlines lower than a 1 star, I would definitely be doing that. I am also going to leave this review in as many places as I possibly can. I am going to call again but I don't have any high hopes of getting any satisfaction. Very disgusted, I have flown UA in the past, many years ago and never had any problems. *** note: this trip did not even happen yet but the block of date of experience will not let me put a future date in it, I haven't even stepped foot on a plane and all of this has happened to me already.",Negative with Suggestion

"It's pretty hard to precisely aim it onto any small object (such as a close button or edge of a browser to drag or some position somewhere in a typed word) with acceleration turned on or off. It's super weird that I need to lift my middle finger from the mouse to use inertia scroll; if my middle finger is resting on the mouse, index finger scrolling doesn't have inertia. And of course, there's the famous charging port on the bottom. Other than that, it's quite nice, well built, and pleasing to use mouse. Oh, and it pinches fingers that I hold it with on the sides on every click, because entire top surface goes down.",Negative

"We had been using the Aveeno Wash & Shampoo for as long as we can remember for our little one. I couldn't be happier with the results! This gentle cleanser not only effectively removes dirt and impurities, but it also leaves out little ones skin feeling incredibly soft and hydrated. The formula is infused with natural oat extract, which soothes my skin and helps maintain its moisture balance. I love that it's suitable for daily use, and it has a pleasant, subtle scent that makes my shower feel like a spa experience. Overall, it's a fantastic product that I highly recommend for anyone looking to nourish their little ones skin while cleansing.",Positive

This is not my first issue with United Airlines, however back in September of last year I decided not to complain.Upon contacting them to discuss the matter, I was basically called a LIAR although I can evidence the payment taken in error and the impact this has had.I would recommend paying a little extra to fly with another airline, this will be the last time I travel with them period.",Negative

"This streaming platform had already started to lose a lot of quality shows and fill up with very low quality, low rated movies and TV shows. The streaming platform began relying on a few shows like Stranger Things to hold it together (especially after certain shows like breaking bad ended or the walking dead which kind of fell off). The household feature, however, is the reason I'm leaving this review. I am a college student living several hours away from my family and it doesn't take this into account. It would rather force me or my family to pay double for this platform which already went up in price to 16 dollars. I've seen you can add another person for 8 dollars but it isn't worth spending over 20 dollars a month when there's plenty of other platforms that allow both my family and I to stream shows. The least they could have done was limited log ins to a certain number of devices. Honestly it was greedy of them and I can't help but think it was an act of desperation due to other streaming platforms offering better content.",Negative with Suggestion

"I used it for about 10 months since last March. One day, the part below the handle came off, and a few days later, the handle completely detached. I tried fixing it with epoxy, but it didn't work.

However, they mentioned that the exact same color wasn't available, so they sent a similar one. Still, I'm satisfied!",Positive

We've been using this Aveeno Baby Wash for two years now. We like it because it has a soft smell and can be used as both a shampoo and as a body wash. We actually switched to this brand when our son started showing some skin sensitivity and it really helped. He doesn't have any more skin sensitivity but we will continue to use it anyway. We recommend!,Positive
"United Airlines canceled my flight because a first-class passenger insulted a stewardess. The 80+ year old woman used a profanity, and the flight attendant then asked her to de-board. She refused and United instead took everyone off the plane instead. They eventually canceled the flight 5 hours later. In the meantime, they only provided drinks and sandwiches to around half the people because they apparently could not drum up enough water, drinks, and food for everyone in one of the world's largest airports. Shame on you United. You honestly need a new leadership team.",Negative with Suggestion

"Netflix has a year to win me back.

I was an early subscriber to Netflix streaming, and went for years with little to no service cancellations. I loved it.

Then I had to let it go for a couple months, back in 2022. For financial reasons. 

Well, someone hacked my account, changed the language, added 10 other accounts, resumed &amp; Upgraded my service…

 and Netflix blamed me.

Seriously they only offered THE DIFFERENCE in what I normally pay, not a full refund. Even though I was CLEARLY hacked &amp; had OBVIOUSLY ended my account a couple months back. When I said not to pay the differences my bank could handle it, they refunded that small amount anyway, and then tried to do a full refund after my bank put in a FRAUD CLAIM.

Like. The app is fine. Im mildy interested in the game library that didn't exist last time I had the service. They are the trailblazers of streaming, and the app still reflects that. 

The quality is there. But don't fall in love with their shows cuz they might get cancelled, and watch your bank account for charges you didn't authorize.",Negative

"When I used to workout, I saw many people carrying around these Casks (for want of a better word) at the club, and constantly addressing ongoing thirst. I wasn't interested at first, too bulky for me. Then I got this one for Christmas, and my viewpoint changed. Fill it halfway with ice, and the beverage you add will remain ice cold for longer than a day. Even better, the ice cubes inside will take a long time, and I mean a long time to melt. The container when filled can be a little heavy because of the size, ounces it holds, and the fact that the container is made of metal. It'll take some serious effort to break this thing, so don't worry that you have to handle it with kid gloves. Lastly, this is a Stanley product. Quality and value are attached to this brand. Sure there are cheaper products, but constantly replacing always ends up far more costlier. Good Luck, Happy Drinking",Positive

"This is thee cutest yet functional think I've bought in forever. The cup holds 40 oz of water and it does keep my ice cold for 2 days. I use it everyday as I am a water loving goddess. The size is perfect for helping me quickly drink my 1 gallon of water a day. I like that the cup has the no slip grip on the handle which makes it easier and comfortable to carry all the places I carry it. It's very satisfying for me to take the cup apart once a week to deep clean it and it's very easy to take apart clean it and put it back together. I even purchased a cute star shaped ice tray for the cup. I came in perfect condition even though Amazon ships then without a box mine for here unscathed, and I dropped it once and nothing happened no dent and no paint chipped off nothing. They are highly customizable and I already know what the next color I want to order. I can say that the cup can get heavy when filled with water and ice but it's not unbearable. The pink is that girly baby pink you see in your cotton candy dreams. I would definitely order this one again and I'm a Stanley girl now.",Positive

"I was very skeptical of purchasing a Stanley tumbler, despite the craze to buy one and the overwhelmingly positive reviews; I remained skeptical and was put off by the elevated price.  I have severe gastrointestinal issues and if something isn't prepared correctly or isn't at the right temperature, I'm going to suffer. Roughly 2 days before I purchased this tumbler, I had made a smoothie placed it in a non-Stanley insulated tumbler, and took it to work.  Two hours later, I had my smoothie, and 30 minutes after finishing it, I was in severe abdominal pain that was so bad that I had to go home early.  Since I've had my Stanley tumbler, I haven't had this issue.  My smoothie is cold when it goes in the tumbler, and 2-3 hours later it's still just as cold as when it was first made. Although this item was a bit pricey, it was well worth it for me.",Positive

So tired of travel. The cost and service are both so over rated. Packed carry on so we can avoid waiting for luggage. Of course there isn't enough room for ours on the plane and the force all 4 to gate check them. As we board there is definitely space for a few more suit cases. Flight attendants also could ask all people with back packs and jackets to stop being selfish jerks and put it under the seat in-front of them.The human race is in a whole new way. I will update when we get our luggage as it is full of gifts. If any are broken I will be contacting for reimbursement!,Negative with Suggestion

There was no food offered other than a small bag of pretzels and a cup of water for a cross-country (5+ hour) flight, I was forced to pay $10 for Wi-Fi service that didn't work, and now I've been told United apparently have a new policy in which they don't adjust fares for bereavement travel. When I called customer service, I was forced into using the text messaging option to try to resolve my concerns due to the waiting period to speak to a representative being over 90 minutes. The United representative that I texted with was not only not helpful, but their messages were full of poor grammar, no punctuation (they often wrote paragraphs with no commas or periods or anything...it was just a run-on, nonsensical way of communicating), and a complete lack of willingness to resolve my concern(s).

"Dear United Airlines,This is what I wrote to United without a response from them. Gave them a second shot and our plane was delayed for 6 hours we were forced to get another airlines flight home and they didn't pay until I complaine they gave me a $200.00 credit for an $1100.00 round trip telling me the flight home was cheaper. Lies!!!!I am writing to express my disappointment as a first-time flyer with your airline. I recently sent a complaint letter regarding my experience and received a reply, but unfortunately, it did not fully address my concerns.My first impression of United Airlines was not a positive one. Despite arriving at the airport well ahead of my flight, I encountered long lines and inefficiency at the check-in counter. The process was confusing, and the staff seemed uninterested in assisting me. This was a significant letdown as I was excited to take my first flight with United Airlines.Additionally, during my flight, I experienced several issues, such as cramped seating, subpar in-flight entertainment, and delayed service. The lack of comfort and convenience made my experience less than desirable.I understand that some of these issues may be beyond your control, but as a customer, I expect a high level of service and comfort. The fact that my experience was not up to par was particularly disappointing as I had high expectations for United Airlines.I would like to request that my concerns be taken seriously and addressed in a timely and satisfactory manner. As a first-time flyer, my experience will impact my future travel decisions, and I hope that United Airlines can take the necessary steps to improve the customer experience.Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to hearing back from you.",Negative with Suggestion

Setting it up was a breeze—just attach it to your items, and you're good to go.The precision of the location tracking is impressive, and I love how it integrates seamlessly with my iPhone. I can easily check the location of my keys, bag, or even my pet on the Find My app. The sound feature is helpful too—it's easy to hear when you're in a pinch and need to locate something quickly.What I love most is the peace of mind it provides. Whether you're traveling or just moving around at home, you can rest assured knowing that your things are within reach. Definitely worth the investment for anyone looking to stay organized and reduce those “Where did I leave it?” moments.Highly recommend!",Positive

Beautiful color every day cup! Easy to wash and very sturdy exterior. Even fell off counter from a naughty cat and it did not dent!,Positive
Worst app ever after the update,Negative
Household makes no sense. You have to pay extra just for a “family” plan to do what its supposed to do. Not every family shares the same wifi 24/7. Basically they wanted to screw over half of their users just to make an extra buck.,Negative
"Paired with their app (so you don't have to keep track of the book), my kids and I love playing with these. These large box options are perfect for your kids creativity to explore and build random things, like my sons robocroc lol. The box will only be a quarter full so you can combine other box sets like we did.",Positive
"Overall I've been quite disappointed with the quality of the information I've received. Also, the content is displayed on a screen which is incredibly blurry!",Negative
I bought this for my kitty that I let outside for a bit and it's good to know I can find her if needed.,Positive
"I would like to get into detail but this course covers the key points comprehensively , must also build a more detailed version.",Positive with Suggestion
The course was quite in-depth. It started at my level (beginner) and lead me through to feel much more confident and knowledgable.,Positive

"I advise you to use it I showed it to my husband, we bought them. My baby's skin is very fresh and they smell  are simple.",Positive
We love this shampoo for our two babies. Last us forever.,Positive
Very informative and I learned a lot of new things! Hopefully this will translate well into my campaings,Positive
"Flight going out, fabulous air stewards very attentive! Coming back very different experience, grumpy air stewards not happy in their job.",Negative
"I have taken several courses on adwords - some free, and some Udemy - and I prefer this instructor (cory) over all others.",Positive
"Absolutely, amazing! I put it through two tests already and I love it it!So far, so good. It seems to be standing up to its buyer standards.",Positive
"They cancelled my flight from Boston to London Heathrow on 21st August, 2023 the day of my departure and was asked to re-book. As I had checked out of my holiday accommodation I was asked to make my way to the airport to get vouchers for holiday Inn Express Hotel Boston. When I got to the airport the staff were not interested and they said that it wasn't their responsibility but because I had screenshots of all the correspondence they then gave me Hotel and meal vouchers. When I got to the hotel I was asked for details of my credit/visa card which I reluctantly gave. To cut the long story short I believe United Airlines did cancel all the vouchers and the hotel ended up charging my card. Only discovered that when I got back home to England,  tried in vain to recover my money from the hotel. Spent days phoning the hotel bearing in mind our time difference until I managed to speak to the manager who then referred me back to the airline.  Managed to lodge my claim but they keep playing mind game, send this and that which I have already supplied. Will never use that airline again. Nasty experience from going and back.",Negative
"I have an AirTag on everything that I need to make sure that I don't misplace… checked baggage, carry-on, wallet, keys, etc. Very easy to use, very quick to pair to your account, it has a really good range and if you're just using this product as normal the battery life on it is pretty good.",Positive
"This has always been my go-to since having my child. The soap is thick, so a little goes a long way. It has a pleasant scent and is very gentle on my little one's skin. The bottle is exactly as described. I have no complaints!",Positive
"It holds its temperature VERRY well, a little bit too well, if you fill it up with ice and put a fridge chilled drink into so your sodas, and your juices it will turn almost so a slushy. Sometimes the lid is hard to take off but if you kinda gently bang the lid on the counter or something it will usually make it a little easier to take off the lid. I use this while I'm trucking and the size is great for sitting in the cup holder.It's a nice simple look on it. Adequate liquid flow in the straw so you don't have to suck on the straw hard at all. It is nice to hold in your hand. I put my cup and straw into the dishwasher and it cleans pretty good but maybe clean the straw separately so the soapy taste doesn't stay for long. When I use this cup, I stay hydrated pretty easily and can measure how much liquid I drink a day",Positive
So in order to use this product you have to use another device to make an account. That's very inconvenient; and they acknowledge it but yet they don't do anything to change it? I dislike the bundles… Netflix just isn't what it use to be and it's actually Pathetic… we had a good thing… but Netflix changed… no more Netflix &amp; Chill… it's Hulu &amp; Woohoo now… at least Hulu throws in Disney+ to spice up the deal…,Negative with Suggestion
"Rude, passive aggressive attitudes from the flight attendants. Infantilized by male flight attendant. No adult traveling with children cares to be spoken to as if they are ignorant, incompetent especially not by persons who are supposed to be providing a service. We don't work for you WE are the customer. Horrible customer service. My minor child was targeted, searched and interrogated at one of the gates prior to boarding. Your airline and poorly rated and there are no shortage of reasons why.",Negative
"I really enjoyed the course, it is very complete with examples and everything. Needs some updating though but the he's getting done little by little.",Positive with Suggestion
Excelente service and product condition,Positive
"As someone who frequently misplaces keys and bags, the Apple AirTag has been a game-changer. This compact, coin-sized tracker integrates seamlessly with the Find My app on my iPhone, making it incredibly easy to locate my belongings.* Pros:- Effortless Setup: Pairing the AirTag with my iPhone was straightforward and quick.- Precision Finding: The Ultra-Wideband technology guides me directly to my items when they're nearby.- Durable Design: With an IP67 rating, it's both water and dust resistant, perfect for everyday use.* Cons:- Accessory Requirement: Since the AirTag lacks a built-in attachment point, purchasing a separate keychain or holder is necessary for certain items.- Privacy Considerations: While Apple has implemented features to prevent unwanted tracking, it's essential to stay informed about these aspects.Overall, the AirTag offers a reliable solution for keeping track of personal items, providing both convenience and peace of mind. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐",Positive with Suggestion

"I wish to thank Eddie, in bagtrack! Who took the time to find my bag. He discovered that I had been given an incorrect file reference number.Once the correct file reference was entered my bag was found and delivered the next day!THANK YOU, EDDIE!",Positive
Good choice for my Granddaughters first set!,Positive
"I really got to know AdWords well! The course is very informative, clear, simple and understandable! I would recommend it to everyone!!",Positive
"I find trying to maintain streaks in apps stressful and anxiety producing. I meditate to when I can and to help myself, and not meditating one day is not a failure, it's just a day I didn't meditate.

I was so happy to find Calm had a setting to turn off streaks. I turned it off immediately and enjoyed not being guilt tripped by a relaxation app.

Welp, the latest update launched and immediately prompted me to add a “goal” of three Calm meditations per week, and added a seven day checklist at the top of the home tab. :( now I can't even open the app without it guilting me towards obsess e behavior :(",Negative
"Somehow the air tag knows when I am actually on a road trip with my luggage as it alerts me as to when I have moved out of range. When my luggage is at home and I go away, the device knows to not alert me.",Positive
It's excellent product for my baby. Have been using since last couple of years.! Only issue I see in packaging. Unable to bring opener up.! Most of time it works but have issue in some.! Thanks,Positive with Suggestion
"Since the moment I began meditating and listening to calm music,soundscapes, and sleep stories (Ya! It's not just meditating lol) I've felt a peace settle over me! I've endured a lot of pain and suffering in my life and I recommend this to anyone even if you haven't suffered severe trauma. I think young kids would benefit the most. Thank you everyone from calm I hope you feel my gratitude 💜",Positive
As a child I also wanted legos but my mom couldn't afford them! I was very surprised when my daughter wanted legos so I didn't hesitate to find them for her! I decided to buy her this as a starter and I must say it exceeded my expectations! Not only does it come with your standard Lego blocks but it comes with cool building and more as well! She plays with them everyday and they are easy to pick up and clean because the container dubs as storage when finished!,Positive
Helps me keep track of my flight risk dogs. Worth the piece of mind. I tried one of the dog tracking devices; it was useless as it never could get cellular service despite paying for a subscription. This works perfectly. I was worried about my dogs accidentally ingesting one; but I found a great holder for the tags to put on a collar. I also used them for our luggage on our European trip. It's nice to get alerts about items no longer being with you. Highly recommend,Positive
I have had this tumblr for three months now. It is the best one I've ever had. Keeps ice in it for days so I think you would love it.,Positive

"Love this set, it allows my students use their imagination and they had lots of fun. I had an issue with the post office delivering the package and the seller was very helpful solving the issue.",Positive
Purchased premium and says to log in under email used to purchase. That's the email I used still it doesn't work. Attempted to contact customer support and it wouldn't let me email them or start a chat.  Never again. Beware if your considering it.,Negative
"The Calm app has truly transformed my daily routine. It's my go-to for finding peace and relaxation amidst life's chaos. The guided meditations and sleep stories are a game-changer for my sleep quality. The soothing sounds and beautiful visuals transport me to a serene place whenever I need it. I appreciate the variety of content, from mindfulness exercises to stress relief techniques. Calm has become an essential part of my self-care journey, and I couldn't recommend it more highly. Thank you for creating this oasis of tranquility in my busy life!",Positive
I was offered $10 a year through Tmobile. I paid for it and logged in though my Apple ID like it requested. In doesn't recognize my purchase and keeps asking me to sign up for $70 a month. I then started getting spam emails telling me I can sign up for $40. The irony is that the app is called “Calm” which caused me hours of frustration and troubleshooting is almost funny. Almost……,Negative
"Whether for the hair or body, this Aveeno product is gentle on our child but strong enough to clean even after the messiest days! Despite best efforts, babies still get shampoos in their faces and eyes. The tear free formula is a life saver! The scent is mild enough to leave nothing specific behind - perfumes aren't always appropriate for kids. The pump is perfect for learning hands!",Positive
"Do not fly United! The airline has significantly gone downhill. They delayed my flight repeatedly for over four hours with all passengers sitting in the airport waiting for information.  At 11 PM they ended up canceling the flight because they could not find a pilot (their fault). Passengers were told that they could retrieve their check bags, but it would take about two hours.  Minimal help was provided to rebook. To get a hotel voucher I was told to wait in a line that literally had 100 people ahead of me. They were all angry United customers who were having flight problems. I ended up spending the night at a very unsafe hotel, but that was the closest hotel to the airport that had availability. Returned to the airport at 6 AM the next morning to fly standby on the 8 AM flight. Did not make it on, but that flight is now delayed. United has reported that they need to “balance the weight of the aircraft”. But the truth is that they overfilled the aircraft with fuel, and need to burn it off before it's safe to fly (explained by a United employee at the departure gate). I'm Still on standby. This has already cost me $100 which I highly doubt I will be reimbursed for. Save yourself the time, money, and emotional turmoil, and do not fly United!!",Negative
"I've used this app for some time and have enjoyed every moment of it. The options to suit your needs (anxiety, focus, sleep, etc.) provide something for everyone. I highly recommend this app to always have calm moments available to you when you need it! I also recommend this app to my clients as something to try and potentially integrate into their daily routine.",Positive
"They canceled my flight on June 18, 2023, due to their mechanical problem, and they asked us to pay for the hotel and meals ourselves first without any arrangements for that night. They said passengers can submit it to their website and be reimbursed later. They are a liar and never respond to your request. When you contact them, they will ask you to submit to many different departments and say your money cannot be refunded. Hate this airline so much, just feel like they are a thief and have stolen money and are lying to me!!! It is the worst experience I had with an airline!!!",Negative
"This is a good course.  I do recommend it.  However, the AdWords user interface has changed quite a bit since this course was developed.  It can be hard to follow along on many of the examples.",Positive with Suggestion
I prefer to use this over the Johnson baby one.This is a mild body soap which can also function as a shampoo.Leaves the baby smelling fresh with no tears.Much loved!,Positive
Delayed luggage on the 8th May 2022 - claim for expenses agreed on 14th December!! Still waiting for my money 31st Jan 2023. Was told it could be up to 45 days and when chased today was told due to the number of claims being handled - ie all the screw ups they continue to make - it could be 60 days. I live in hope. Shocking service and will never fly with UA again.,Negative
"I wanted a reliable insurlated tumber when I'm on the go! My great niece( a teen no doubt) told the the Stanly Quecher was all the rage now and I shoud ""get with it"".( I had an old time plastic one. Well, I I live the weather was 24 degrees when a friend and I ventured out to run some errands. I packed my Stanley Quencer with green tea and lemon. My friend had a different type.  After three hours we went to sit down in a shopping  mall.She opened her tea and found lukewarm. I put the insulated straw in my Stanley Quencher and tea was still hot, not steaming but a pleasurable tempature to drink. I', ordering one for my friend. Suffice it to say, my teen age niece was pleased when she saw tumbeler on the kitchen table ! I highly recommended this product and they come in beautiful colors, but be conservative I like the black.!",Positive
"The course is very nice, Corey did the great job of explaining everything. I recommend this course to everyone who wants to start learning about AdWords.",Positive
Every single United flight I've ever taken has been delayed. Every time that has resulted in missed connections. This airline may as well be a scam with their lack of being able to provide the service that United travelers pay for and not providing refunds for missed legs caused by their inability to operate efficiently.,Negative
I've been in here for a week. So far I feel like the have good content. The app is nice and easy to use. It asks you how you're feeling and it guides you towards a section that hopefully can help you or get to the bottom of your emotions.,Positive
"Solved our nightmare problems within 5 minutes of speaking to them, when the 3rd party booking provider couldn't solve them for over a month and with 10+ calls.I was just so impressed with how efficient the service was, and my wife and I now have a HUGE weight lifted off our shoulders for our flight back home to Australia from the UK. I'm now a lifetime fan of United Airlines",Positive
"Looking for hours of fun with bricktastic brick play, then this Lego essential is a must have for your family. One of the best purchases I have made, found this great deal on Amazon and glad I did such a variety of bricks and endless building ideas. 10 out of 10",Positive
"Before you read this all, GO WITH A DIFFERENT AIRLINE...got a ticket with connecting flight from Munich to texas then baton rouge. Their customer service sucked. My flight was delayed for two hours which left me only five minutes to get on the next plane. They tried giving me another ticket to two other states in which i would have to pick up my own luggage (that is 50 lbs each) because of their fault. I went back in the line in hopes of talking to a flight attendant crying but they said that they didn't have time to deal with that. I finally got my old ticket back to texas but it was delayed again which got me stuck in texas. it wasn't any different on the plane either. they had problems taking off and the flight attendants were pretty rude. When I asked them if i could sit by the window to get comfier which no one else was sitting there before I could finish my sentence the flight attendance mockingly smiled and said no you can't. Like I was a burden to them like I didn't just pay 1500 dollars for that damn airline. the seats were too narrow and uncomfortable too. I felt like a horse trying to sleep on the plane and spent the whole 16 hours flight crying because of their rudeness and ignorance. . My friend had to drive for 5 hours to pick me up from texas and when I was trying to find my suitcase, they said there was only one showing in the system although I had two. I had paid extra to bring two luggage instead of one. They said they lost my suitcase and that it was still in Munich. I started panicking like everything that could go wrong went wrong. They weren't willing to compensate or work with me, I had to spend hours with a heavy carry-on back on my shoulder because of their arrogance. WOULD STRONGLY SUGGEST STAYING AWAY!!!!!",Negative with Suggestion
"Even a couple windshields and additional wheels would have been a big deal. LEGO made this ""gender neutral"" so there are at least 8 sets of windows but only enough wheels for a single car.Decoration wise it's all pretty equal and the feminine colors are beautiful, but with additional colors you are also severely limited in building, say, a wall.This set is for if you already have a big collection, not as an introduction to Lego.",Negative with Suggestion
"4 out of the last 8 flights delayed, last one 7 hours delayed, horrible operations manager at Newark, employees very inexperienced and some quite rude!! Going down United!!!Not what it use to be, probably bad and incompetent leadership!!!",Negative
