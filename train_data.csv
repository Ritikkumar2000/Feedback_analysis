"The only problem I have with the mouse is the fact that it's really not ergonomic at all, but that doesn't really matter. My problem is with the scroll wheel. for some reason the scrolling on macos is inverted, and when you try to fix it, the track pad becomes inverted. its so stupid really.",Negative
"The ads for the game are dangerous for me.
When I heard the brown noise it makes me not breath, and it stressed me out even more.
It's a problem for me, but I understand if it helps others.
Just not me.
I like white noise but the brown noise is kinda bad.
If someone has the same anxiety problems as me, it might be dangerous.",Negative with Suggestion
"I've been using this app for 4+ years now and it has become an integral part of my life. My mental health has improved since and meditating routinely became possible because of this app. I love the way it is setup for all background levels and has many other useful lifestyle improvement based aspects like better sleep, focus and movement. I would recommend this app to anyone who is looking to work on those things or even just trying to explore the fields of mindfulness and positive psychology and/or appreciate a well made app.",Positive

"Filed a report with Apple and Bank. 
Says in App Store, and on iPhone subscriptions as valid for one year but when trying to open premium or restore purchase options it just says to sign in with the Apple ID used to purchase… 
This is my one iPhone with one 20 year+ Apple ID. As someone who has purchased hundreds of apps, this is the first time none of the normal recovery steps work (as an IT Professional).

"I downloaded this to try to find a free meditation app. There are so many subscriptions that I was hoping this free version would be decent. It's not. In the middle of meditating, and finally getting my body to relax, ADS start playing. Do you know how jarring that is to a nervous system? Listening to calm music and all of sudden loud ads playing! I understand that these apps if free sometimes will have ads.. but geeeeez let people finish listening to a 15 -30 min meditation that you advertise as FREE before playing ads. 
Sad that even something that is supposed to help the mental health of people is trying to first find a way to make money off of you",Negative with Suggestion

"My goal is to drink 60 oz of water a day and I've used the iron flask and the Stanley I much prefer the Stanley.in order to meet my goal of 60 oz I have to refill my tumbler three times a day so turning the lid is important it has to be easy with the iron flask it took 5 turns. the Stanley takes 3 turns to open and close the lids. I don't like the pop-off lids because it hurts my thumb and having to do this three times a day is not fun.  All those seals are waterproof.Water mixed with 5 drops of Cassia oil gives sweet cinnamonny taste to water. In the Iron Flask Tumbler, with the casia oil mixed with water I can taste a metal taste. The Stanley tumbler, I taste this sweet taste of casia oil and water, there's no metalic after taste.",Positive
"Unique application, what to share with you and unusual way to use the AirTag and that is to take a spare with you when you travel and have a rental car and attach it to the rental car keys that way when you misplaced the rental car keys, you have a prayer finding them if you lose rental car keys you can expect to pay hundreds of dollars For replacement",Positive

"Simply put, I paid United money I should never have spent with them.  I'll pay $100+ per ticket more to fly with anybody else in the future unless they finally communicate with me about the issues (not automated emails).1. Terrible, worst in my life, flight experience in June 2023.  Traveling with my family of 4.  I've flown hundreds of times and never had anything like it.2. Phone support has no authority to do - say - or help in any way, so a Supervisor gets on and says the same thing to fill out a form online and otherwise they can't help.  United takes no ownership. They solved the issue ""their way"" with a $200 credit (didn't ask for this) and won't communicate in any way otherwise. Waste of time. Waste of money.Waste of Father's Day 2023 dealing with this.My only request is reasonable, I think and so do the support reps who can't assist with it: I want a live person who cares about customers to call me and discuss my fair ask for not a full refund, but only a 1/2 refund.  Only the leg of departure.  Possible?  I doubt it with United.",Negative with Suggestion

"I hate United airlines, first time flying with them and last. Over 3 hour delay for things they supposedly take care of when we are waiting to board like freaking fuel! Then having to deplane after boarding then board again. Then FINALLY made it to the worst airport Birmingham,Alabama airport! We waited almost 2 hours for our luggage to come down because they said they were short staff,if they were short staff then at least allow us to get our fam bags so we can go. My foot is swollen from standing long periods, the United baggage person disappeared and didn't come bck bc of all the complaints. They were elderly people, pregnant women and others like myself with health problems and no chair to sit, no customer service support and my husband called and was told they always do stuff like that, the f…k! Who cares you are short staff just give us our dam luggage. Birmingham Alabama airport with United airlines you are taking a chance on something happening. Hell they might forget their dam pilot! The worst experience in my life with flying and I fly very often. Never United because they ain't uniting anyone or thing, United airlines is the absolute Worst. Please consider anyone but them when traveling unless you don't mind people wasting a lot of your time. They could of offer to send us our luggage or something besides they awful service they provide,",Negative with Suggestion

"These mice are simply the best you can get for your Mac (I haven't tried one on a PC but now that I think of it, I think I will, just to see how functional they are). The top of the mouse is a touch-sensitive surface and you can scroll, zoom, switch desktops and perform many other functions with just fingertip(s) on the surface. They are wonderfully ergonomic and make mousing a breeze. I am a computer professional and often spend entire days using the mouse almost constantly; I've never used a better one. They are solidly built and are rechargeable. I am currently using a Magic Mouse I got in 2016; I've never had to change a battery or do more than clean it now and then. I have several others for the other computers in my home and offices; I have never had a problem with any of them. Not one.The only design flaw with this device is the charging port. It was put on the bottom of the mouse and connecting a lightning cable to recharge it means that you cannot use it while it is charging. This is not a problem for me; at the end of every month, when finishing for the night, I connect both the mouse and my wireless keyboard and leave them overnight; in the morning they are 100%. All the same, I wish that Apple had put the charging port on the ""nose"" (front) of the mouse so that it could function like a regular wired mouse while charging. They charge VERY quickly too.",Positive with Suggestion

It was very good as I am new to this but was discouraged seeing the 'Copyright 2013' at the bottom of the demo slides from the presenter.

"I cant complain enough about my experience with United, it has been an on going nightmare with this company. I have had to navigate (unfortunately) 3 separate flights with them. No matter who I talk to, manager or not, they do not follow through on their jobs. They have repeatedly messed up my flights/ credits/ cant take my forms of payment- and I have LITERALLY spent 7 hours on the phone with them the past 2 weeks. THATS ALOT OF TIME!!! I am appalled and will avoid them at all costs in the future. I have currently been on hold (for the uncountable time) for over an hour waiting for them to figure out how to accept ANY of my credit or debit cards that will not go through. I hate united airlines and I don't use that word often",Negative
"I have just been completely extorted by United Airlines. My name is Jonathan, but I booked my flight ticket under Jon, and now they're charging me approx. 50% of the entire ticket price just to re-book and change the name. Anybody in their right mind can see that Jon is a derivative of Jonathan and this is a very simple administrative error. How on earth they can charge this much extra (almost an additional £350) and still sleep at night is beyond me.The phone operative I've been speaking to has insisted there is no other option. I fully intend never to fly with United Airlines again. Meanwhile, I'm enormously disappointed with Lufthansa to have partnered with such a corrupt entity as United Airlines seem to be.No wonder their ratings are so low on here.This should be illegal.",Negative

"Has some nice spoken relaxation segments, that are quite well done.  Also a lot of natural sound segments, rain, distant thunder.  My main complaints are:  Not enough spoken content, and of those they are very brief - less than 10 minutes.  Calm is a captive app, you can't download useful content to any other app like iTunes.  So if you find a spoken exercise that really helps you, you have to maintain the Calm app account to listen to it.  There is a lot of sound files that seem to be there as 'filler' as opposed to useful spoken content.  Finally, the price is ridiculously high for what you get.",Negative with Suggestion

"My wife and I flew to Cody Wyoming from jacksonville Florida in October 2022 to hunt wild game. All bags showed up except firearms. They didn't deliver until the next day at noon. 20 days later we returned to jacksonville our home.  Same thing happened, all bags showed up except firearms for hunting. United was helpless trying to track our firearms, same thing happened to others on both flights.

They have short hair and it's easier, I don't know how it would work for longer hair.",Positive

"The Apple AirTag is exactly what I needed. It's simple, effective, and does its job without any fuss. Here's why it works:Why It's Great:✔ Super Reliable – The tracking is spot on. Whether it's attached to my keys, bag, or pet, I can find it with ease.✔ Easy Setup – Just tap it to your phone, and it's good to go—no complicated setup.✔ Compact & Sleek – It's small enough to be unobtrusive but still noticeable if needed.✔ Works with the Apple Ecosystem – Integrated seamlessly with Find My, so I always know where my things are.It's an AirTag—plain and simple—but it works exactly how you expect it to. If you need a tracker for your stuff, this is the one!",Positive

The status bar time and battery persists while viewing episodic content. It hides automatically while viewing movies. It hides automatically viewing videos on any other app also.

"The Apple AirTag was an absolute lifesaver on our trip to Europe! We put one in our luggage, and I'm so glad we did because our bag did not arrive with us. Thanks to the precision tracking and real-time location updates through the Find My app, we were able to pinpoint exactly where our bag was, which helped the airline locate it and get it to us much faster. Being able to track its progress gave us peace of mind and eliminated the stress of a truly lost bag.Some great features of the AirTag include:Precision Finding (when used with an iPhone 11 or later)Ultra-Wideband Technology for accurate location trackingLost Mode Alerts to notify you if your item is foundLong Battery Life (lasts about a year before needing replacement)After this experience, we'll never travel without them again!

"I am a college student that literally lives 40 minutes away from “my household”, yet Netflix still seems it pertinent that I pay for my own separate account even though my parents pay for the separate screens plan. This is ridiculous and if I can't find a way around it we will be deleting our membership. You complain that your business is losing money from sharing passwords yet a quick Google search will reveal that y'all made $32.12 Billion for the last 12 months, a 3.56% increase from the previous year. It shouldn't even be considered “sharing a password” when it's with your own family. Stop the dramatics about net revenue and get rid of this new “feature”!",Negative with Suggestion

"I recently got my hands on the Apple Magic Mouse, and it has been a revelation! Here's why it deserves all five stars:Sleek Design: True to Apple's signature style, the Magic Mouse is a minimalist's dream. Its white, glossy finish is not just a visual treat but also complements my Mac and iPad perfectly.Seamless Connectivity: The Bluetooth connection is flawless. Pairing it with my devices took mere seconds, and the connection remains stable, ensuring uninterrupted productivity.Rechargeable Convenience: The built-in rechargeable battery is a huge plus. It charges quickly and lasts for weeks, eliminating the hassle and expense of constantly replacing batteries.Multi-Touch Surface: This feature is an absolute game-changer. The Multi-Touch surface allows for intuitive gestures like swiping between web pages and scrolling through documents. It makes navigation smooth and effortless, enhancing my overall workflow.Comfort and Precision: Despite its slim profile, the Magic Mouse is surprisingly comfortable to use for extended periods. The precision of the cursor movement is exceptional, making tasks like photo editing and graphic design a breeze.Delivered on April 30, 2024, near the front door or porch, my package arrived in acceptable used condition, but it functions like new. For $44.10, it was an incredible deal! Though the return window closed on May 16, 2024, I have no regrets.In summary, the Apple Magic Mouse is a perfect blend of style and functionality. Whether you're a professional or a casual user, this mouse is bound to elevate your computing experience. Highly recommended!",Positive
"Was debating on this purchase as well as the color, and I must say that I am thrilled that I finally purchased this Stanley. Pairs with every bag and outfit that I have, which is a nice plus. Not too heavy yet it feels well made and durable. Love the size and the fact that the tumbler itself isn't too bulky. Definitely recommend purchasing in some of the darker colors and the Stanley products as well, they are worth the hype and popular for a reason! Love the fact that the lid is so easy to open versus the Yeti where you have to pull the lid out to refill. Stays cold even with little ice and the design again fits easily into my tote bag and my center console. I would only drink water or something similar versus a thicker beverage or a hot coffee, doubtful it would be a problem just a thought! Love love this tumbler!",Positive

"This review is for the USB-C version of the Magic Mouse only.When I bought this mouse, there was no disclaimer that it will properly perform only on Sequoia 15.1.1 Apple said that it worked with OS's back prior to Ventura, so I felt safe.  (To be fair, I do not know whether it works on the beta release of Sequoia 15.2).I was running Ventura 13.6, and when I connected the Magic Mouse, it only functioned as a regular mouse - no gesturing, no scrolling, etc.  Button clicks kind of worked, but not always.  I tried it on multiple macs, but the results were the same.I returned it, and purchased a replacement:  same results.  After doing some research, I found others that were having similar results, and finally saw that people had isolated it to only working as advertised on Sequoia 15.1.1.After upgrading my macOS to Sequoia 15.1.1, the USB-C Magic Mouse works as advertised.I hope that Apple does the right thing and a) publishes a note regarding the compatibility issue, and b) issues a patch to Ventura, Sonoma so they, too, will enable this terrific mouse to work as intended.",Negative with Suggestion
So tired of travel. The cost and service are both so over rated. Packed carry on so we can avoid waiting for luggage. Of course there isn't enough room for ours on the plane and the force all 4 to gate check them. As we board there is definitely space for a few more suit cases. Flight attendants also could ask all people with back packs and jackets to stop being selfish jerks and put it under the seat in-front of them.The human race is in a whole new way.

I mean look at this mug!  It's solid and top quality, heavy duty yet I have no issues toting it.  You can clean it easily as the top is a wide opening.  If you accidentally tip it on its side, which is practically impossible, only the straw will leak liquid and usually you can right it before that happens.  It is well-balanced and keeps contents really cold (for a couple days even) or I suppose hot, although I use my Stanley Captain's mug for that.  Maybe you've heard some folks say that the Stanley mugs aren't cheap... well yeah, reliability and quality that perform and last are priced accordingly, but I consider these an investment in a solid product I will be using for a long time to come.",Positive

When I press pause the audio mutes but playback continues. If I press menu to leave the show it doesn't remember my watch history so when I restart the show or film it goes back to the beginning. Jogging doesn't work to fast forward either, so the only thing that works is using the 10 second jump to either go forwards through the show to where I left off, or let let the muted playback go and use the 10 second skip to go back to where I intended to pause.",Negative

I went back in the line in hopes of talking to a flight attendant crying but they said that they didn't have time to deal with that. I finally got my old ticket back to texas but it was delayed again which got me stuck in texas. it wasn't any different on the plane either. they had problems taking off and the flight attendants were pretty rude. When I asked them if i could sit by the window to get comfier which no one else was sitting there before I could finish my sentence the flight attendance mockingly smiled and said no you can't. Like I was a burden to them like I didn't just pay 1500 dollars for that damn airline. the seats were too narrow and uncomfortable too. I felt like a horse trying to sleep on the plane and spent the whole 16 hours flight crying because of their rudeness and ignorance. . My friend had to drive for 5 hours to pick me up from texas and when I was trying to find my suitcase, they said there was only one showing in the system although I had two. I had paid extra to bring two luggage instead of one. They said they lost my suitcase and that it was still in Munich. I started panicking like everything that could go wrong went wrong. They weren't willing to compensate or work with me, I had to spend hours with a heavy carry-on back on my shoulder because of their arrogance. WOULD STRONGLY SUGGEST STAYING AWAY!!!!!",Negative

"Literally just the worst customer service I have ever experienced. Flight was delayed out of EWR for almost 9 hours in one hour increments, during which passengers were left on their own while gate staff disappeared. When they were there, inquiries were met with either snotty remarks, attitude, or ""we don't know"", and advice ranged from ""call the toll free number"", ""go to terminal C and ask them"", or ""sit tight."" Staff was never up front without us about the reason for the delay, and kept changing stories when they did finally decide to tell us anything. Finally, the captain, a stand up guy, came out and spoke to us, but by then we'd all been sitting around for about 10 hours. Missed a business event because by the time staff decided to be honest, all the flights for the next day were booked. My colleague had to cover it alone. Once flight was canceled, we were told to go pick up our luggage on the baggage carousel. When it wasn't there, we were told there was no one to unload it until the next morning, 5-7 hours later. The entire flight had to wait in line to speak to a baggage clerk. It was now 230 am. When I got up there, the curmudgeon who waited on me barely made eye contact, didn't seem to care that I'd been up about 24 hours by then, and gave me attitude when I apparently used the wrong term to describe what I wanted (my bag delivered to my home so I didn't have to sleep on the floor of Newark airport to wait for it). Hint: If you don't like people, don't work in customer service! My friend actually went to EWR in person over a week after I was told the bag would be sent to my home in about 48 hours and was told the bag would be on carousel 9. After she spent about 5 hours total waiting, she was then told it was being shipped to my home. Had to buy a ton of things to replace items in my bag because no one would give me any idea when it might arrive. Customer service on phone said I could file for reimbursement. The bag finally arrived 12 days after the flight had been canceled. Remains to be seen whether I will be reimbursed. Abysmal, disgusting. How they are still in business is beyond me, but I imagine it's because no one can actually contact them to get a refund! Between waiting on line for a chat and the phone I may have literally spent the equivalent of  an entire work week waiting. News flash: customers have jobs and cant spend 3 hours on hold waiting for an update from customer service reps who also have jobs, but apparently prefer not to do them but instead tell us literally anything that comes to mind. I even wrote the CEO on the night this all started. Not that I expected him to respond, but even a form response would have been nice. They offered me 30K miles for me to forget the whole thing, but why on earth would I ever fly them again? At least not by choice! Horrid, wretched, third world level operation. Delta looks even better now!",Negative

"Despite having a dedicated place for them, I cannot keep up with my keys. I specifically bought an AirTag to put on my keychain so I can find the darn thing. Yayyyyyy, ADHD. Anyway, it's made by Apple, so it's wonderful quality and integrated seamlessly with my iPhone and iPad (and I'll probably see if I can link it to my iMac because I'm constantly misplacing all my things all the time). I like the AirTag's size and I know it's durable because it's made by Apple. The accuracy is great; every time I have lost my keys, my AirTag leads me to them pronto.",Positive
"Apple products are such high quality it practically goes without saying but I said it anyway. The one thing I did not like about the Magic Mouse were the seemingly sharp edges on the top due to extreme cut over angle from top to sides. Therefore, I turned it off and pulled out a file and proceeded to gently file the edges down. I then used a fingernail emory board to finalize the rolled edge. Now it feels wonderful under my fingers. I have it four stars since I had to customize it before I felt comfortable using it.",Negative with Suggestion
"My entire family decided to go to Florida this coming May 2023. I booked this flight in September 2022 for myself only, I am not going the whole entire time that everyone else is. I have 2 dogs that I have never been separated from and I have anxiety about them. My friend was going to stay at my house and now due to her husband's medical condition has to cancel on me. When I booked this flight, I spelled my entire name out for the agent, I also asked her if this was refundable (just because of any emergency that I might have to cancel the trip, little did I know at the time this would actually happen) and she said yes it is refundable. I get my confirmation of the ticket in my email and my first name and last name has errors in it. I know from experience working on the phone that a lot of letters sound the same so that is why i always spell out my full name. So I go on the computer on their website and ""chat"" with a live representative.  She claimed she fixed it, I asked her to resend the confirmation, she would not.  I asked her when i get to the airport will I have a problem with the paper copy and email that I have with the wrong name on it. She told me no it is corrected.  so time goes by until this month, January 2023. I find out my friend isn't able to come up, I am in a panic. I call the customer service again to cancel the ticket.  I am told that it is a non refundable ticket. Then when he was asking me to confirm my name and I was spelling it for him, he said it was wrong. I saw red. I told him everything that had happened, he kept apologizing that she told me it was refundable and about my name. He told me that he will fix my name but it is another additional $99 charge to do this. I said this isn't my fault I spelled my name for her letter by letter using a name to clarify it, like D for dog. I should have never gotten it fixed but I went ahead and did it.  Well I am looking for boarding for my dogs and I am disgusted with what I am finding. so I call back 2 or 3 days later and talk to another agent. I again asked if I could get a refund and he said unfortunately no.  I asked if i could upgrade my seat to a refundable one for another $100, and again he said unfortunately I cannot. then I told him the story about the name change and I feel that I should not have been charged that $99 for the change since I did not enter my name into the computer, I spelled it out for that agent. He totally agreed and told me he was going to send an email to his superior, he could see who took the initial call. he also said he was going to carbon copy me on the email.  I am still waiting for that email to come through to me. I guess that was never done either, because I haven't heard a word from United from anyone. all of this was even before I even had a chance to stop foot on the plane. I have decided that I probably am not going to go on this trip, I am waiting for a call back from one more kennel and I don't have high hopes about that one either. So they won't refund my money because of an incompetent agent who you could barely understand to begin with. So I guess they expect me to eat the $500 loss. if I could rate United airlines lower than a 1 star, I would definitely be doing that. I am also going to leave this review in as many places as I possibly can. I am going to call again but I don't have any high hopes of getting any satisfaction. Very disgusted, I have flown UA in the past, many years ago and never had any problems. *** note: this trip did not even happen yet but the block of date of experience will not let me put a future date in it, I haven't even stepped foot on a plane and all of this has happened to me already.",Negative

"Booked a 6pm flight from Newark to Heathrow. Our flight was delayed FOUR hours. Was due to arrive at Heathrow at 6am, instead we arrived at 10am. We had a British Airways flight the same day scheduled at 12pm to Malaga, Spain. WELL, due to the FOUR hour United delay, we missed our British Airways flight.  (which means we lost $$ we paid for our flight) There were no other flights to Malaga that day, so we had to stay at a hotel in London. (Had to pay more $$ for hotel and to book another flight).  Between our hotel in London and losing money on our missed flight AND paying for another flight, the DELAYED United flight cost us an additional $2399.47!!!!

I have severe gastrointestinal issues and if something isn't prepared correctly or isn't at the right temperature, I'm going to suffer. Roughly 2 days before I purchased this tumbler, I had made a smoothie placed it in a non-Stanley insulated tumbler, and took it to work.  Two hours later, I had my smoothie, and 30 minutes after finishing it, I was in severe abdominal pain that was so bad that I had to go home early.  Since I've had my Stanley tumbler, I haven't had this issue.  My smoothie is cold when it goes in the tumbler, and 2-3 hours later it's still just as cold as when it was first made.

"This is the best addition to any MacBook Pro ever! The pad is extremely awkward to use if you're a first time MacBook Pro owner. This is our first MacBook Pro and it has a learning curve that you have to get use to using if you want to use the love that it is wireless via Bluetooth and eliminates the need for using one of the few USB ports on the MacBook Pro. It makes using your MacBook more convenient and easy to navigate than using the pad that is built into the laptop. Our MacBook Pro is the space gray version and we bought the same color mouse. I've used the wired mouse on the older Apple Mini Macs in the past and it was just a little bit different than what I was use to using which was a Windows OS mouse. If you're a first time MacBook Pro user, you should invest in this mouse. The charge is great and last for several days or hours depending on how long you use your MacBook. The pad is a real learning curve and this will help eliminate a lot of frustration when you are a new MacBook Pro owner.As far as gaming goes, I can't exactly say how well it works as I am not a gamer. But the response time , in my opinion, is fast and I think there are other options for gamers that are really into gaming that own a MacBook Pro and I'm sure they are aware of those options.I have owned three apple desktop counting the latest MacBook Pro and those both had a wired mouse and keyboard that was separate from the Mini Mac. Sitting down with my new laptop was quite a different experience than the other Apple desktop's that we have had in the past and it is not like a Windows laptop in the way the pad works , but this was worth the price of not relying on the built in touchpad which I had a lot of learning to do if I was going to rely on the MacBook Pro built in pad.  Not a big fan of the white keyboard and mouse as we have had two different sets of the white items and they start to look kind of dirty after a few months of use. The one thing I absolutely miss about the older Mac Minis that ran on the Intel processor is that the newer M3 chipsets don't have the ability to run Parallel's which most people know what that means. I don't really miss the ability to use Windows on my MacBook Pro now anyway because it was always the source of all of the problems we had with the older Mac minis in terms of malware and viruses. I do however miss the CD or DVD drive as well because I have a lot of Japanese MQA CDs and they can be unfolded to enjoy the full potential with a external drive and the software that you can buy for the MacBook Pro. It gets the most use as a MQA decoder than any other type of computer usage. We have the newest iPad Pro versions and they are almost as good as the MacBook Pro. I have heard that the newer versions that are coming out are going to be basically the “MacBook Pro Killer” as they are supposedly going to have a lot more RAM and powerful processors and the ability to run programs that only a desktop or MacBook Pro can handle now. But I think the price point is probably going to be outrageous for most people.My only regret is that I didn't get the MacBook Pro Bluetooth keyboard in the space gray when they were more a available, because they are extremely hard to find now and expensive in comparison to the standard white model. The keyboard has to have the finger print reader on it as I would like to sit in in a cradle instead of having it opened up on my workstation. So that makes it even more difficult to find and expensive. I have seen used ones sell for twice the price of the new white version, but it is the only thing that is really left to buy for this set up.",Positive with Suggestion

"Thanks to United Airlines for taking the time to make our trip into a nightmare. I hope that this review will help you avoid the insane level of anxiety this experience has caused.I previously had a good experience with Lufthansa Airlines and chose to book a trip with them again, or so I thought. The flight was advertised as Lufthansa, but in reality, it was a Lufthansa flight “operated by United Airlines.” I had not used them before but figured they should be good as they were chosen as a partner with my preferred airline—mistake number one.At the airport, there were only kiosks to check in. I flagged down an employee—a rude woman ordered us to produce the credit card we used to pay for the trip. She took the card, shoved it into the machine, pointed at the screen as if we should have known that, then walked away.We boarded our first plane. The seats were cramped. The flight crew was pretty cold and uncaring, bordering on rude. The inflight service was a small cup of generic, flat soda or juice that tasted like wastewater. But thankfully, we had two families with screaming children and parents who were blissfully unaware that everyone on the flight hated them.The connecting flight was a nine-hour hellscape with the same screaming children, oblivious parents, but different yet still rude flight attendants. They had two meal options and ran out of one. They said we would have to wait until the business class passengers were served to see if anything was left, but “no promises.”When we reached the destination country, the third leg was on an actual Lufthansa plane, and the experience was like night and day. The staff was friendly and talkative, with a sense of humor. It was a good experience that we were expecting.For the return flights, each United plane was delayed for various reasons. When we tried to find our gate (not marked on the boarding pass), the staff told us to go upstairs. When asked which way, we were sarcastically told, “It doesn't matter.” We luckily found an airport police officer who guided us in the right direction. We reached the connecting plane and were among the last three or four people to board. When we opened the compartment above our seats, the flight attendant screamed, “If the lid is closed, it is full!” No offer of help at all.They closed the doors, and ten mins later, the Captain announced that the plane (that we were on) arrived with mechanical problems, and they could not fix them, so everyone would have to deplane and move to another gate about a half-mile away. No one was pleased. We arrived and had to wait for the flight crew to show up and pretend nothing was wrong.Arriving at our final destination (home), we were directed to where to pick up our luggage. We discovered they did not forward the bags because apparently *WE* did not tell them to (despite having connecting flights). Our luggage was still halfway across the country. We gave them our info, and they said they would track them and deliver them the next day.The next day only 1 bag is delivered. No one has a clue there are supposed to be 2, despite us providing both tracking numbers on the receipt they gave us. I called, and after a 45 min hold, I was told the second bag was not forwarded because *we* did not tell them to forward it with the first one. The person on the phone said they would look into it and said the DELIVERY company would call me. The delivery person calls and says they were only given one bag and knew nothing about the other. I call again, and another person said that the second bag was in the other airport because, again, *we* did not have it forwarded. After some intense conversation, he says he will request it to be shipped and delivered. The next day comes and goes, and no bag. I called back (another long hold session) and found that it was NOT forwarded because (you guessed it) *we* did not request it to be forwarded. Fast forward to three days later, I have *FINALLY* received the bag. The delivery company was kind and understanding, but not a peep from the damn airline that caused this misery.This experience has been, without a doubt, the worst experience with any airline. This was our FIRST experience with United Airlines and our LAST one. Do yourself a favor. Avoid United Airlines at all costs. You will thank me.",Negative

Tried using an off-brand magic mouse first and was causing power issues with my Macbook so I opted for the more expensive Apple Magic Mouse that I was used to from my previous job. Works great. I am a video editor and I love being able to scroll without a wheel in the direction that I need without having to hold down a keyboard button to change directions between horizontal or vertical scrolling. My only complaint with the Apple Magic Mouse is the charging location which is on the bottom and renders the mouse useless while charging. This has been a problem ever since they created these but thankfully the battery lasts a long time before needing to recharge. This is definitely my favorite mouse to use with a Macbook.,Positive with Suggestion
"I find trying to maintain streaks in apps stressful and anxiety producing. I meditate to when I can and to help myself, and not meditating one day is not a failure, it's just a day I didn't meditate.

"Netflix has a year to win me back.

I was an early subscriber to Netflix streaming, and went for years with little to no service cancellations. I loved it.

Then I had to let it go for a couple months, back in 2022. For financial reasons. 

Well, someone hacked my account, changed the language, added 10 other accounts, resumed &amp; Upgraded my service…

 and Netflix blamed me.

Seriously they only offered THE DIFFERENCE in what I normally pay, not a full refund. Even though I was CLEARLY hacked &amp; had OBVIOUSLY ended my account a couple months back. When I said not to pay the differences my bank could handle it, they refunded that small amount anyway, and then tried to do a full refund after my bank put in a FRAUD CLAIM.

Like. The app is fine. Im mildy interested in the game library that didn't exist last time I had the service. They are the trailblazers of streaming, and the app still reflects that. 

The quality is there. But don't fall in love with their shows cuz they might get cancelled, and watch your bank account for charges you didn't authorize.",Negative with Suggestion

They will delay your flight multiple times, and then they will cancel your flight (due to ""severe weather conditions,"" which from what I can see in Newark and what my husband can see in Orlando is nonsense). They have zero (I mean zero) consideration for their passangers. I actually feel embarrassed for them. They offer no food to compensate for the wait, and on top of that they have a bunch of unfriendly, unempathetic employees (the perfect employee for this pathetic excuse of an airline)--cogs that couldn't rise to the challenge to go beyond the level of a cog--working behind their counters. Their cobwebbed brains impede them from taking into consideration people's exhaustion or chronic illnesses that they might have.

"Stanley Quencher Tumbler ReviewThe Stanley Quencher Tumbler has become a staple for staying hydrated on the go, and it's easy to see why. Designed with both style and practicality in mind, this tumbler offers features that cater to busy lifestyles while maintaining a sleek aesthetic.Pros: 1. Durability: True to Stanley's reputation, the tumbler is made with high-quality stainless steel that feels solid and long-lasting. 2. Insulation: It keeps beverages cold for up to 12 hours or hot for 7, making it perfect for all-day use. 3. Capacity: With sizes ranging up to 40 oz, it's great for anyone who wants to drink plenty of water (or coffee) without constant refills.Cons: 1. Price: While it's an investment, some might find it expensive compared to other tumblers. 2. Size: The larger models can feel a bit bulky to carry around. 3. Availability: The popularity of certain colors and designs sometimes makes them hard to find.Overall:The Stanley Quencher Tumbler is worth the hype for anyone looking for a reliable, stylish, and functional drink companion. It's especially great for those who are serious about hydration or want a product that can keep up with their active lifestyle.Would I recommend it? Absolutely—if you're willing to pay a bit more for quality and convenience.",Positive

My flight details aren't on United's system anymore, they think I was on a flight a whole year before I was to a completely different destination.

"I had never used AirTags before, nor completely understood the application of AirTags to prevent theft, find your devices, or get an alert to your phone when leaving an item behind - such as your tagged wallet or keys.I tagged my keys and my wallet.  If I walk out the door without either item, I get an alert to my phone indicating I've left the item behind.  The AirTag can then by tracked by my phone and will direct me to the precise location of the item, such as my keys or wallet.Before AirTags? I used to search for items that fell behind the couch or that I dropped getting out of the car or credit cards (tagged wallet) that I left in the restaurant.  If my wallet were stolen, I would get a ""separation"" alert showing the location of the stolen wallet.  Of course, I would then immediately disable my credit cards.These provide a great piece of mind in my daily hectic life.  After I bought the first one, and learned how they worked, I bought two more (with cases) for my luggage.  You can also put a tag on your dog's collar or in your child's backpack.

"I am a disabled person who travels with a mobility scooter. I proactively notified the ""Special Needs"" department and filled out the (customer wheelchair information) form relative to my scooter. In spite of my efforts to make it easy every flight began with mayhem. I found ALL the United gate agents lacked the knowledge / training when presented with my (common) scooter. In comparison, I have taken numerous international trips with Delta and American without any scooter related difficulties. The crowning blow occurred at the Brussels airport where I missed my connection due to an inexcusable wait for an aisle chair, (needed to get me off the plane). The (aisle chair) attendants tried their best to make up the time by rushing me through Customs and speeding through the airport while keeping their dispatcher informed of our ETA to the gate. Two family members, traveling with me to help, went ahead to the gate along with my carry-on bag and crutches, while I waited to get off the plane. They were already at the gate and checked in but would not board without me. As soon as I arrived the gate agents told my family ""Okay he's here, get on the plane!"" then they closed the gate IN MY FACE and my family /helpers were not allowed to leave the plane. Nine hours and two flights later I arrived at my destination. Additionally, on my return flight to IAD, United personal misplaced my scooter and it took them and hour to find it.

The Bluetooth connectivity is flawless, and the battery life is incredible, lasting weeks on a single charge.One downside? The charging port placement on the bottom means you can't use it while charging—but with such a long battery life, I rarely find it to be an issue.If you're a Mac user looking for a premium, smooth, and intuitive experience, the Apple Magic Mouse is well worth it.

"I have been super excited to try the Apple Magic Mouse.  I finally bought one yesterday.  I was able to get it same day since I live close to a distribution center!Here are my thoughts:Likes:Build Quality and Design: The Magic Mouse lives up to Apple's reputation for premium build quality and sleek, modern aesthetics. It fits perfectly with my Apple Magic Keyboard and looks fantastic on my desk.Trackpad Surface: The multi-touch surface is truly a game-changer. It allows for intuitive gestures like swiping and scrolling, making navigation smooth and effortless.  Seriously, it took almost no time for me to realize this is better and easier than using a trackwheel or left/right mouse buttons.Seamless Connectivity: Pairing the mouse with my Mac was a breeze, thanks to its flawless Bluetooth connection. The connection remains stable, ensuring uninterrupted productivity.I am coming from a Satechi setup.  In all three of these areas, Apple's Magic Mouse is superior.  However, this in no way implies the Satechi setup is bad.  I guess it's all about bang for the buck.  Apple's setup is substantially more money.Dislikes:Scrolling Speed Adjustment: I had to make changes to the scrolling speed in the settings to suit my preference. While this wasn't a major issue, it did require some extra time.  It would be ideal of Apple could figure out how optimize this out of the box, by making adjustments based on your existing mouse and settings.Charging Port Placement: The charging port being located on the bottom of the mouse is less than ideal. It makes it impossible to use the mouse while it's charging, which can be quite inconvenient.Price: The Magic Mouse is on the pricier side for a mouse. Although it offers excellent features and design, the cost may be a consideration for some.Additional Insights from Other Users:Many users have praised the Magic Mouse for its sleek design, intuitive multi-touch surface, and seamless connectivity. The rechargeable battery and its long-lasting charge have been highlighted as significant improvements over previous models. Some users have noted the excellent performance in detailed tasks like graphic design and photo editing. However, the placement of the charging port and the high price point were common points of criticism.In summary, the Apple Magic Mouse is a perfect blend of style and functionality. Whether you're a professional or a casual user, this mouse is bound to elevate your computing experience. Highly recommended, despite a few minor drawbacks.",Positive with Suggestion

"We booked a flight for Cozumel leaving NWA on 05/09/23 at 6:45 am.   We received a text 05/08/23 at 9:50 pm almost 9 hours prior to our flight of possibly storms.  Unreal.   We spent several hours trying to get everything rebooked which we did for the following morning for a 6:45 am departure. Our 2nd attempt to fly out the following morning we woke up at 3:30 am to a text stating our Houston connection was delayed 1 hour and 15 minutes due to mechanical issues and our replacement plane would arrive from Mexico. While waiting to board our first flight in NWA and the agent stated our NWA plane is now delayed around 30 minutes.  We finally board and arrive in Houston, the replacement plane arrives, we were told it is now delayed due to mechanical issues.  We had over a two hour delay here. All this on top of canceling our flight from the day before which did not have storms anywhere around us.  When we did fly out we had storms we flew into and out of in Houston.  We lost an entire day at our resort as well as stress and time getting everything resolved.  We will never fly United again.   One last thing the website said we could not bring a normal sized carry on in the plane.  It had to be something size wise like a 12 inch purse.  If we tried to bring a normal sized carry on we'd be charged $35 to check it at the gate.  When we arrived we saw others who had the larger carry on's and were allowed to board with them.  The agent said the plane had  enough room for 25 regular size carry on bags.",Negative

"We recently from home from Tampa to Brussels via Dulles. Both flights were OK, but... Our connecting flight from Dulles left almost 2 hours late, allegedly because ""the incoming flight had been delayed"". Which is weird, because when I checked our luggage status on the United App it said the luggage had been put in the hold 30 minutes after we touched down in Dulles. My TV screen on the Dulles-Brussels leg didn't work. I reported this but nothing happened. Luckily there was an empty seat the other side of my wife. The food was unspeakably awful. I know airlines need to make economies to boost profits after the losses they incurred because of COVID, but this was dire. The bread rolls were like bricks. The salads looked as if they'd been prepared a week before. And the mains were simply disgusting. Couldn't eat them, they were so bad. I used to fly Continental a lot and they were really good, probably the best US carrier. Then they merged with United. Now it sucks. Next time, we'll try another airline.",Negative

"On the positive side, buy the white one it works as well as the black one and is a lot cheaper!After using standard mice with batteries for years, I have a steep learning curve ahead of me. In fact when I use my MacBook sitting on the couch, I don't use the mouse at all.I really can't rate it properly until I have used it for some time.

A bunch of criminals. Never fly United. I should have looked at videos on YouTube before flying with them. Absolutely disgusting company,Negative
"Initially, I was skeptical given all the negative reviews on the mouse primarily for its ergonomic features. I'll admit, it's not a mouse I would use all day, and when I first used it, I did experience slight discomfort in my wrist. Frankly, I think many people are exaggerating though. This mouse along with all of its features makes using it a fun and productive experience. Take the negative comments about this mouse with a grain of salt, because in reality, it is a great product. As for the charging port on the bottom, it's whatever really, I bought this mouse months ago, and still has over 75% battery, so in reality, again, another problem people are blowing out of proportion. Definitely buy it!",Positive

It's a sleek addition to any setup, and it just works.",Positive

"First Impressions:I was so excited to get this Stanley tumbler, but I was disappointed with how easily it scuffs. While I understand that shipping conditions aren't in the company's control (it arrived in a paper envelope and got banged up), I did expect it to be more durable. For a tumbler known for its toughness, I was surprised at how quickly it showed wear.🎯 Product Features & Performance:The color is absolutely beautiful, and the insulation is amazing—it kept ice frozen for two full days! That's exactly what I was hoping for. However, one downside is that it leaks easily—even when slightly tipped. I wasn't expecting it to be completely spill-proof, but I did think it would be a little more secure.✅ Pros & Cons:✔ Gorgeous color – looks just like the listing✔ Keeps drinks ice cold for days – excellent insulation✔ Comfortable to hold and use❌ Leaks easily – even when slightly tilted❌ Scratches and scuffs too easily – not as durable as expected🛠 Who This Product Is Best For:If you're looking for a tumbler that keeps drinks cold for days, this one does an amazing job. However, if you want something that holds up well to daily use without showing wear too quickly, you might want to keep that in mind before purchasing.💡 Final Thoughts – Would I Buy Again?I love how well it keeps drinks cold, but I do wish it was a little more durable and resistant to wear. While it serves its purpose, I was hoping for a bit more toughness from Stanley.",Positive with Suggestion
"Aveeno Baby Daily Moisture Gentle Bath Wash & Shampoo with Natural Oat Extract has been a trusted part of our bath routine for the past six years.

"This streaming platform had already started to lose a lot of quality shows and fill up with very low quality, low rated movies and TV shows. The streaming platform began relying on a few shows like Stranger Things to hold it together (especially after certain shows like breaking bad ended or the walking dead which kind of fell off). The household feature, however, is the reason I'm leaving this review. I am a college student living several hours away from my family and it doesn't take this into account. It would rather force me or my family to pay double for this platform which already went up in price to 16 dollars. I've seen you can add another person for 8 dollars but it isn't worth spending over 20 dollars a month when there's plenty of other platforms that allow both my family and I to stream shows. The least they could have done was limited log ins to a certain number of devices. Honestly it was greedy of them and I can't help but think it was an act of desperation due to other streaming platforms offering better content.",Negative with Suggestion

"The picture is the biggest house I could build exclusively with ALL of the 4x2 bricks included in this set.As you can see, its just enough to be high enough to cover the minifigures head (not included), but there are not enough left to build a roof.Yes, you could finish the house with other pieces, but at this price, I should have enough 4x2's to build a reasonably sized house.4x2 bricks are the workhorse of creative building with Lego, no matter how much LEGO has attempted to market smaller, more complex and specific creations as the 'new' heart of Lego, and not buildings and houses. Any child who grew up with Lego knows its *ALL* about the 4x2.This is a 790 piece set, with only *67* 4x2 bricks.On average, most colors only have FOUR 4x2 bricks - !?The 4x2 is relatively large and expensive, so Lego sells sets with really high piece count - like this one at 790 - but uses tiny pieces no one cares about to push up the piece count. In this case, only 8% of the pieces are 4x2's....and I love Lego's response to people's complaints about 4x2's - 'hey, come to our website and buy by the BRICK' - where 4x2 pieces are $.30/pc!I don't even think LEGO *wants* to sell these building sets anymore (this set was created 'by demand!'), because the vertical sales of endless expensive, complicated *model* sets of licensed characters (like its own, or Batman, Star Wars, etc) are much more lucrative. Most of these sets aren't even buildable by kids until they are competent readers who can follow complex instructions, and once they have built it, the bricks have little or no replayability. Build the model, you're done. Did I mention these model sets seem half the size of as the picture on the box?Some of Lego's model sets are completely phoned in as well - the original Minecraft sets, for example - uh, my kids and I have played ALOT of Minecraft - the original Minecraft sets - I don't even know what they were *supposed* to look like - they looked like a mess - and, of course, where Minecraft is a game of large 1 meter square blocks, the LEGO version was comprised of tons of the tiniest pieces I have ever seen. Once we opened the box, we didn't even bother building our Minecraft set, it was so disappointing.Having bought only one other model sets other than the Minecraft one, I don't even like my kids to see the model sets in the store - because yes, the cover art is exciting and cool, but I know that the out-of-the-box experience is not. Dad will wind up building the entire thing, my daughter will play with it for 5 minutes, start taking some pieces apart, and it will be nothing more than a mess of tiny toy pieces no one plays with for the rest of its lifespan.I have talked to other parents, and Lego's strategy is a universal disappointment.Lego, the 'CLASSIC' Lego experience is having a child open their first set of legos, which is mostly 4x2, so they can build big, beautiful buildings of their own imagination. You can sell your one-off model kits, but let's see you sell at least ONE set which is mostly 4x2, and bring that core experience of replayability back to kids of this generation.I chose this set because it does contain some parts I think are important for a core set - like windows, doors, and wheels - but when I see the vast number of tiny useless filler this set has, it just makes me upset about what kid's experience is with modern Lego marketing.",Negative with Suggestion

"It holds its temperature VERRY well, a little bit too well, if you fill it up with ice and put a fridge chilled drink into so your sodas, and your juices it will turn almost so a slushy. Sometimes the lid is hard to take off but if you kinda gently bang the lid on the counter or something it will usually make it a little easier to take off the lid. I use this while I'm trucking and the size is great for sitting in the cup holder.It's a nice simple look on it. Adequate liquid flow in the straw so you don't have to suck on the straw hard at all. It is nice to hold in your hand. I put my cup and straw into the dishwasher and it cleans pretty good but maybe clean the straw separately so the soapy taste doesn't stay for long. When I use this cup, I stay hydrated pretty easily and can measure how much liquid I drink a day",Positive with Suggestion
They changed their policies to only having one account in one household but if you upgrade they can charge you more for multiple household but this upgrade still doesn't work.

"Bought this for my daughter as a ten year olds birthday request. She wanted pink or purple in 32 or 40oz that's it but being me, I figure she needed some stuff to go with it 😆! It was $45 for the 40oz Peony Pink color. I thought the lilac was also gorgeous but this pink stood out so strongly and in stores they only carry the hot pink 40oz that has an orange logo on it. I don't think it's as attractive as the one o bought and I don't think she enjoys orange either. It's sturdy and sleek and comfortable in the hands. The screws were standing out so heavily as fine quality upon notice. No scratches or scuff. Super clean. No Oder!!! Thank God!!! I hate strong oders. It does have gaps where you can easily see it'll leak if it's full and you tip it over but being the dad that I am i bought the stoppers as well and they fit so snug. Could still leak but it's not supposed to be upside down so like… who cares? And seriously you really have to work hard at getting it in a position that causes it to leak. The stoppers I bought for snuggly so I'm very satisfied with the leak stoppers I bought on Amazon, I left a video of the before and after installing them in the other sellers review section. I would know how to link this one to that one but hope you find it and that it helps. But if you don't buy the stoppers, Honestly get over it nothing is literally perfect except Jesus so just enjoy the cup, it's phenomenal even without the stoppers. The stainless steel or titanium is what it actually looks like is superb by the look and the feel!!!  The pink paint is gorgeous!!! Taylor Swift probably made that song about this Stanley 🤷🏾‍♂️ I seriously wouldn't be surprised. I have no cons for you honestly. It's a wonderful buy and I get it now why she wanted one and why my girl friend also desires a Stanley. I really questioned why that brand of all brands like it's just a cup, like it's not that serious?! 🧐 but low and behold! Boy! It is that serious and for the price amazing and again, I could not find this color anywhere in the real world. So thanks Amazon! Thanks to the seller and thank you Jesus we have the internet and apps that make life easier for everyday day citizens like you dear reader who took the time out to read my long winded commentaries 😂. Hope this and the pics and videos help you making your decision. I'm fully intending to buy one for myself in some bold manly color if I can find one.If your worried if it's fake or not, you can compare them to the others online:#1 Screws are located underneath the handle and are aligned well. Using the same metal as the inside of the drinking canister which is really think is titanium and not stainless steel actually. Because it's definitely superior grade quality. Trust me you'll know the difference looking inside it 😆#2 the straw comes in the cup already with no separate packaging and is the same semi-cloudy tone as the upper lip of the cup and is not totally transparent or translucent.#3 the inner canister of the metal bottom will have an etched in recycled sign at the very bottom.#4 the Lion logo on bottom of cup.#5 the Lion logo on upper half of the cup will be about an inch or so from the lip of the cup while a fake will be two to three inches lower, much further from the lip of the cup.#6 the top of the cup handle will be super close to the top of the stainless steel part while a fake will be noticeably further from the top of the top (like inches or so away from the lip of the cup).So this one is real! And I highly recommend it!",Positive

"First let me begin by saying I'm writing this in a fit of Rage. I've been using Netflix through various different accounts for years, always through family members. I've seen countless movies and shows and they've been worth the $10-16 a month- up until this past year, the disappointment, disgust, anger, confusion- a company so large so vast- THE COMPANY TO SHUT DOWN BLOCKBUSTER? A shame a true shame I tell you now. I can say that the sadness I felt the first time I saw that “member of household” butt crap, was unmatched. I am revolted, I've dedicated so much of my life to the good deed of doing right unto others for that is what Jesus would do and this is the thanks I get? Selfishness from those who hold such power? This is abuse, this is an atrocious act against humanity, community, friendship and family across the globe. I can only imagine what kind of vileness and hatred went towards this cowardly and cheapskate act against the good of the people. I just hope that one day you can look back and tell yourself that in the end you did the right thing, the right thing for your countless and I mean COUNTLESS customers, we're more than customers we're families we're acquaintances, we're coworkers, we're exes. we are more than subscriptions, we're a community and your the ones holding us together, you built this site from the ground up with joy laughter and entertainment for all through many years, don't tear it down in one with greed.

"Purchased ticket for my toddler and her father for an early flight. They arrived in time to check-in and get to their gate, but the employee signature of SAT-PD-QK decided they could not board because they were not there 45 minutes prior to boarding time. Their flight was at 0715. He spoke to her at around 0635. Plenty of time to get checked in and to the gate. She said it was their policy. Checked United website. No policy clearly states this. No statement in the email confirmation. Went through the process of purchasing another ticket and no prompt or or notice saying stating this apparent policy of United's minimum time. Called customer service. No help there. They said I could either be refunded and they lose their seat or I can keep them on the later flight.

Nothing on the site that clearly states this policy. Shame on you United. Shame on you for treating customers as pieces of crap just BECAUSE YOU CAN!

"United just can't seem to get it right... EVER!  At least we are still sitting at the gate for over an hour so I have some time to write a review.  First, we barely made it to this flight as our flight out of BNA (UA1830) was delayed and pulled into the gate in IAD 15 minutes late.  Now we are sitting in the plane at the gate for our next flight (UUA932) for over an hour.  It's great that they decided to wait for other, delayed, connecting flights, however completely forgets people who have prior arrangements at the other side which they are now delaying.To joke and scam of an airlines, and next time I book through Lufthansa and realize it is with their partner airline, I will gladly request another flight.Don't waist your time flying United, unless your life depends on it.  Maybe even then, but they might not get you there alive.Also, remember, the star rating system is truly only 4-Stars, meaning they have a .6 out of 4.0 for a reason.  Wish we could actually give them 0.",Negative

"Worst airline I have ever been on - even Spirit Airlines is top tier next to this one. Paid for seats that had more leg room only to find out there was no place to put our personal item; no under the seat area, and the flight attendants allowed people to use the overhead bins that were above us. Even though we were the next section right behind first class our tickets were still section”4”? Meaning we were last to board. Needless to say come takeoff 2 flight attendants were rude and said I needed to put them in an overhead bin, I asked where? As all of them were full and they said to look around. I ended up going through the entire plane to get to the back where there was a spot; it's slightly understandable, and I've never had such unhelpful or rude flight attendants like that before. I would rather sit on a bus for 9+ hours than do a 1 hour flight with this airline due to the stress and exceptionally high cost. Avoid this airline if you can.",Negative

"Compagnie aérienne à fuir !Quelle mauvaise expérience, un cauchemar éveillé actuellement : United Airlines a annulé nos deux billets retour pour raison de ""vol annulé"". L'unique proposition possible, alors que nous sommes tenu en étau à trois jours de notre départ aux États-Unis, est un vol tôt le matin, ce qui nous enlève une journée complète de voyage. Pour le même prix alors que le billet de matin, au moment de notre réservation, était bien sûr beaucoup moins cher... Nous sommes otâges de cette compagnie, car la seule autre option c'est un remboursement, mais à quelques jours du départ, imaginez la flambée des prix... Et qu'elle ne fût pas notre surprise ce soir de découvrir que des billets pour notre vol ""annulé"" sont encore en vente, à un prix exorbitant... Quelle déception, quelle amertume que cette expérience avec United Airlines. À FUIR",Negative

"Actually “Not Good” is too kind for United Airlines.  They are just pathetic!  Why?   For the last 7 tickets we booked, they CANCELLED 6 of them.  They even cancelled the replacement tickets on three of them and then proceeded to place those on a standby flight.The disruption this causes and the money that is lost from their incompetence is flabbergasting.  AirBnB bookings that is too late to cancel has to be paid for regardless of the fact that we sit 12 hours at Newark, bleary eyed, hungry and frustrated.  Rental cars paid for and then new arrival times at the destination airport forces more time wasted because we have to wait for the rental car places to open.United just pulls their shoulders up and essentially goes “ megh!” when we call.  They gave us $20 for meals on the 12 hour delay at Newark, you can purchase a dry sandwich at a vending machine for that.  They partially refund hotel fairs that are lost.  Don't fly United Airlines!  They suck!",Negative

"BEWARE OF UNITED AIRLINES, AND AIR CANADAOn July 15, I hired Kathy Gill, Busy Time Travel, Avoya Network to become my agent regarding an upcoming trip to Churchill Manitoba. She arranged flights with United Airlines and Air Canada for November 1, 2022.  Twice my flight were cancelled. Neither time my flight was rescheduled, nor did the airlines notify me. On October 11, I called Air Canada to ask which gate I should arrive at. They told me that my flight had been cancelled on Sept. 12.  Had I not contacted Air Canada about departure information, I would not have known. I spent hours with both airlines in the next two days. I was charged another $163 from Air Canada. I had to purchase new flights to Winnipeg. United told me I was due a refund of $26, and refused to give it to me. I informed both United and Air Canada that only I be allowed to make any further changes. They agreed.On October 31, Gill emailed me. She stated my entire, original $805 United/Air Canada charge was disputed by me. It was not. Once again, I had to call the airlines to confirm that her allegations were incorrect. Once again, much more wasted time and stress.Again, on October 31, less than 13 hours before my departure, Gill cancelled my flights with United and Air Canada. The airlines never informed me. They allowed Gill to cancel the flights that I made on October 11, despite their assurances that Gill would noy be allowed to intervene. I spent hours again on the telephone hours before departure hoping that I would be allowed to depart.  This new flight resulted in a three hour earlier departure, with an extra stop in Chicago. On November 1, I had to spend more of my vacation time trying to arrange another flight home.On October 12, I sent a letter to the Scott Kirby, the CEO of United. A copy is enclosed. I also emailed a letter to Michael Rousseau, the CEO of Air Canada. Of course, neither responded.These airlines have caused me many, many hours of work, stress and extra expenses. This has been a pitiful experience for me. They have nearly sabotaged my entire $8000 trip to Churchill, Manitoba.I believe that I am eligible for compensation and refunds.",Negative with Suggestion

"I recently purchased the Apple Magic Mouse to pair with my MacBook, and overall, it works well with the Apple ecosystem. The sleek design is what you'd expect from Apple—modern and compact. It fits well with my minimalist setup.Some key points: • Great Integration: The mouse connects instantly with my MacBook, and I appreciate the smooth multi-touch gestures for scrolling and swiping. • Battery Life: The rechargeable battery is long-lasting. I only need to charge it occasionally, which is convenient.That said, the flat design can be a little uncomfortable for extended use, especially if you're used to a more ergonomic mouse. Also, it's on the pricier side, so I expected a little more in terms of comfort.If you're in the Apple ecosystem and value design, it's a great choice, but there are more comfortable options available for heavy use.",Positive with Suggestion

The use of screencasts makes this class truly applicable and achievable for me (49-year old, non- tech savvy entrepreneur).  Without somebody showing me exactly how to do it, it would have just been interesting, but not something I could accomplish on my own.  I posted a question during the course and Corey emailed a reply within 48 hours.  I would rather pay for something and get value than watch something useless for free.  I didn't know about coupons so I paid the full $99 price and I still feel like I got a bargain.",Positive
"I flew with United Airlines from Sydney Australia to London Heathrow with a connecting flight in Texas in January 2023. I had checked in 2 bags in Sydney and was advised the bags will be transferred to the connecting flight in Texas. When I landed in London Heathrow only 1 of my bags arrived on the baggage collection. I reported my main bag as missing and was advised that it would be delivered to my house in the next few days. Fast forward to 13th April 2023 and lots of phone calls and emails later, United have admitted they have lost my bag and would be compensating me with $1900 although the contents of the lost case claim that I submitted was for $2999. Fast forward to today I am still waiting to receive the $1900 and am being advised it can take up to 90days for them to process the payment.

"The Apple AirTag is a useful and straightforward solution for keeping track of my belongings. Setting it up was quick and simple—just a tap to connect with my iPhone, and I was good to go. Its sleek and compact design makes it easy to attach to items like keys, bags, or even my wallet.The location tracking is precise, and the Find My app provides a clear view of the item's location. When I need to locate something nearby, the Precision Finding feature is especially helpful. It uses haptic feedback and on-screen directions to guide me to the exact spot. The sound the AirTag emits is also loud enough to hear from a distance, which makes it easier to find items when they're buried or hidden.The battery life is impressive, and the AirTag uses a replaceable CR2032 coin cell battery, so there's no need to replace the whole device when the battery runs low. It's also water and dust-resistant, which adds to its durability for everyday use.While the AirTag works well for finding nearby items, if it's far out of Bluetooth range, it depends on the broader Apple network to help locate it, which works most of the time but isn't quite as immediate as I'd prefer in some situations.Satisfaction with Packaging: The packaging was secure, and the setup was straightforward without any issues.Likelihood of Recommending: I would recommend the AirTag to anyone who wants an easy, reliable way to track their belongings.Price Reasonableness: The price is on the higher side for a small tracker, but the quality and seamless integration with the Apple ecosystem make it a worthwhile investment.",Positive with Suggestion

"Yes, I have a confession to make. I'm ""the baby"".  Years ago, I quit using ""bar soap"" and began trying different body washes. I wanted something that would not dry out my skin especially during wintertime. Many did well with the cleaning, moisturizing, and lathering up part, but I disliked the strong deodorizing scents they used.  When trying different baby washes, the scents were gentle and my skin did not dry out, but I found they did not lather-up well. However, Aveeno has a nice rich lather that spreads easily, it does not dry out my skin, and it is lightly scented.  I just started using it a few weeks ago and waited to write my review. I wanted to make sure I liked it before recommending it for your baby ... or for yourself. (Shh! I won't tell).",Positive
"United lures in clients with attractive ticket prices which turn out not to be available once you want to pay. This however isn't shown on their webpage. the webpage asks you to call United. When you do this they tell you the flights are no longer available or at a much higher price. In my judgement this is misleading. United seems to be cheaper than other airlines but turns out to be more expensive. As said this is misleading and I even wonder if United isn't obliged to respect the pricing as the comment of ""system failure"" is only made after paying has been declined.",Negative

"This may be just another example of how awful United Airlines is.  The flight from Minneapolis to Denver was uneventful.  The flight was late, as usual, leaving Denver.  Arrived in Durango an hour late.  Waited and waited for baggage.  It never came.  The only United person around said the only people that could help were loading another place.  After a long wait, there was finally someone to talk to.  When asked about the bag the response was, 'oh sometimes they arrive early and sometimes they arrive late.'  Another passenger said that sometimes, if they send bags early, they are up at the ticket counter.  That is where the bag was.  Wasted an hour because United has stupid and lazy people working for them and their communication sucks. And if you want to comment on how lousy they are, they offer a comments section that is so complicated that most people give up rather than waste their time writing something that probably won't get read anyway.",Negative with Suggestion

"We've flown on our journey this summer many times with United and we were dissatisfied every time. First, they cancelled TWO Non-Stop flights of 10 hours just 2 weeks befor our trip and put us on flights with stops, that are both 5 hours. This means the plane is smaller AND less comfortable seats - so no normal first class seats, that you would expect on a 10 hour journey. On top: We could not pick our seats in first class. There were seats assigned to us and so we are now all over the plane and can not sit together. From old planes, to extremly rude and unhelpful staff - there was everything. BUT the highlight is the lounge situation. We've booked first class - in every normal airline this guarantees a spot in the lounge. But not with United. Because we're flying “First INLAND” we are not allowed in the lounge. Only “First INTERNATIONAL” is allowed there. And Hawaii to New York is still inland. Thats a joke, right? We would have needed to buy a “One Day Pass” for 60 dollars per person. Such a bad customer service is unheard of. Would never fly with them again. Really really bad. And so unhelpful.",Negative
Absolutely horrible airline. They don't enforce the rule to put personal bags under the seat and carryons on the oberhead compartiment wich results in not having enough space for the people who were charged extra to keep their carry-on.

I know I'll have this shoe for a couple years to rotate out with the other color choices I already have. Clearly the price and availability has turned into a real downer! Can't just run to a shoe store to buy anymore and the price has doubled from years past!. Might have to move on someday!.,Negative with Suggestion

"The United gate agent at the Washington Dulles Airport was arrested and fired for stealing my jewelry that was turned into her by a fellow passenger. United did not respond to my calls or emails for over a year. This is how they treat their million mile fliers. They burry the issue and hope it would go away. They ignore loyal customers. To make matters worse I was pregnant at the time. There's so much wrong here. It's a shame it was an airlines I once loved and supported. There are so many other airlines, choose another one.",Negative

"I'm EXTREMELY DISSATISFIED!! It's UNACCEPTABLE! I was stuck in Newark Airport, NY for over 40 hours, due to a flight cancellation. Rebooked in for a new flight, 40+ hours was the wait. Newark was my connecting flight location. Toronto was my final destination. Before finding out about my cancelled connected flight, my check in baggage was rechecked in. Since I was spending over 40 hours in the airport, I actually spoke to UNITED Baggage Counter Service 3 TIMES! To know the whereabouts of my bag, and I wanted it with me during my wait in the Airport. The 1st time, I was told that even though my bag was rerouted, I could collect it and have it with me, then I could recheck it in before boarding my new flight to Toronto. I was told to do this by visiting baggage service the next day. The next day is here, it is my 2nd time. I was told it'll take 12 hours for me to retrieve it, ""look out for it at carousel 9"" I was told. And I could recheck it in. The 3rd and final time I spoke to Baggage Counter Service, this person behind the counter told me something completely different, he said that since my bag has been rerouted, I no longer have access to it until my final destination. And I was PROMISED that it will be with me on my new Toronto flight. 3 times, with 3 different answers. PICK A REASON! Saying that, luckily I saw my luggage on carousel belt 9, attached with the reroute label and all. I picked it up to get my phone charger which I really needed. I asked one of the baggage workers if I could keep my bag with me and I will recheck it in. They said NO. It's in the system, and it's guaranteed to be with you. I finally landed in Toronto and what do you know. Not only did my bag not show up, but I found out that it's still in Newark Airport!! I know this because UNITED Baggage service in Toronto tracked it for me. Look, cleary you can tell I'm annoyed and angry at this point, who wouldn't be?? Having been already frustrated waiting around for 40+ hours, now I have to deal with another problem. Again, I was GUARANTEED that it will be with me. I've already made arrangements to get it delivered to an address, it'll take 2-3 days for me to receive it. But this is still UNACCEPTABLE!! I was PROMISED TWICE that it'll be with me and be taken care of. Basically, I was mislead and LIED TO IN MY FACE!! I 100% deserve compensation for this!",Negative

I originally purchased AirTags to place in all of my family's luggage. Airlines are always misplacing luggage and using an AirTag helps with locating them. I recently purchased a dog collar that has a place for an AirTag. My puppy has gotten loose and we added an airTag to the collar. You will be alerted when the battery needs to be changed (after about a year). Easy to purchase batteries on Amazon. Easy to install.  Everyone needs airtags.,Positive
I constantly am dropping my purse different places around the house and spend more time looking for it so this has been a great help in locating it quickly as I'm headed out the door. Would highly recommend to help people,Positive
We recently went on vacation and put an airtag in our luggage.  Upon arriving at our destination our luggage wasn't at baggage claim.  I could easily track it on our phone and showed he airline employee and they were able to locate our bag for us.  Very easy to set up on your iphone.  The functionality of it is great easy to use.  Great as a gift for someone who travels a lot too.  Accuracy is amazing!  Even can make a sound if you lost an item near you like a wallet or keys.,Positive

"WARNING — if you are thinking of signing up for the free 7 day trial, you will be charged for a year's subscription and you will not be able to cancel and be refunded.  Be certain you want this app for a year because by signing up for the free trial you will pay $69.99 and it won't be refunded if you try to cancel.

I tried the app, didn't care for it and tried to cancel the next day.  There is no way to cancel this ‘free 7 day trial.'   Support is of no help.  The only thing I was able to cancel was the annual renewal for next year.

I bought this for my cat's collar to keep track of him if he got out of the house.  It was always accurate showing where he was and I felt very secure knowing it functions well.

"When I used to workout, I saw many people carrying around these Casks (for want of a better word) at the club, and constantly addressing ongoing thirst. I wasn't interested at first, too bulky for me. Then I got this one for Christmas, and my viewpoint changed. Fill it halfway with ice, and the beverage you add will remain ice cold for longer than a day. Even better, the ice cubes inside will take a long time, and I mean a long time to melt. The container when filled can be a little heavy because of the size, ounces it holds, and the fact that the container is made of metal. It'll take some serious effort to break this thing, so don't worry that you have to handle it with kid gloves. Lastly, this is a Stanley product. Quality and value are attached to this brand. Sure there are cheaper products, but constantly replacing always ends up far more costlier. Good Luck, Happy Drinking",Positive

The tracking is not super precise in motion; if you are tracking your item as it moves it can take a few minutes to sync. I've used it before to find my car in a big university parking lot, for example, so I don't have to worry about finding where I parked after a long day of classes.

"Rude, abusive, and xenophobic baggage handlers. An older United Airlines baggage-handler (name-tag read Sandra) at Rochester(NY) International Airport called me “nasty” for objecting to her abusive behavior. Our suitcases were NOT above the weight limit, as visible by the airport scale. But she refused to check in our luggage, saying we either had to pay $500 or take stuff out. She said unless we wanted to fly another day, we had to listen to her. She only accepted our two suitcases when each fell 2-3 pounds below the weight limit-- again, visible by the scale. The supervisor said nothing; he just stood there and watched as this woman continued abusing us for 15 minutes. When I said to the supervisor that they should at least have the decency to apologize, another female baggage-handler said I was nasty. The supervisor, again, said nothing.

I had the most horrendous experience at Newark airport. Our flight was announced as delayed. Then it was announced that it may be canceled and we should rebook our flight. Then we receive a text that the flight would leave at 2:30 at original gate. When we waited there we were told the flight number and gate number was changed and to proceed to gate 90 for a 12:30 flight. When time for boarding came they told us we were not on that flight and then had to stand in line for 2 hours to get rebooked. I have flown frequently for 30 years and never been treated like this by any other airline. This is my first and last time flying United airlines. We finally get rebooked for a flight on another airline for the next day and now we have to find our baggage that was off loaded from the plane that never took off. So we have to stand in another line for 1/2 hour to find out how to get our baggage and we are time it may take 2-3 hours or longer to retrieve it. This is a nightmare that never ends.,Negative
"We no longer have a family account due to the password sharing rules. The extra cost to allow other people to use the account would strain our already limited finances.

I was trying to watch a show with my long distance friend and I couldn't because of this. Also, not only do they keep canceling good shows, but they keep removing my favorites.

I kinda ask the addendant if they could comp water or Powerade and she told me to call customer service she was ""too busy"". I was in shock. Instead of giving realistic delay times so we could leave the airport, or book other flights... United slowly increased the delay hour by hour due to maintenance. I finally get on the plane to Maui for our 7+ hour flight and there are no screens nor free wifi. I paid extra for economy plus seating.

On October 8th I get a message saying “here's a 7 day trial to come back to Calm on Us” after the 7 day trial I would be charged $69.99 for the year premium account.

"Last year I bought a new Mac Mini. Of course, it's just a box and requires a mouse, keyboard and monitor. My wife had an old, dead iMac, so I borrowed her keyboard (took it, actually lol). I had a monitor. But what I didn't have was a mouse. So my wife dug up an old Jolly Comb she'd been using on something else. One of those that requires you to plug in a dongle. Since it's battery powered, it also goes to sleep when you haven't used it for x minutes. Meaning you lose the cursor.And you lose a USB port. I do some music production, and that means I need USB ports, as many as I can get. So I finally got this Apple mouse, which I'd used years before.Un-plug the dongle, pair the Apple mouse once with a USB cable, and voila! I have a very responsive mouse, the cursor is always there (unless I'm typing etc.) and freed up that valuable USB port.Free of wires, another free USB port - life is good! :)",Positive

Giving legitimacy to corrupt voices is wrong in any context without proper disclosure of the corruption (both ethical and moral are denied in some documentaries, yet their voices are heard as truth).

"Do not fly United! The airline has significantly gone downhill. They delayed my flight repeatedly for over four hours with all passengers sitting in the airport waiting for information.  At 11 PM they ended up canceling the flight because they could not find a pilot (their fault). Passengers were told that they could retrieve their check bags, but it would take about two hours.  Minimal help was provided to rebook. To get a hotel voucher I was told to wait in a line that literally had 100 people ahead of me. They were all angry United customers who were having flight problems. I ended up spending the night at a very unsafe hotel, but that was the closest hotel to the airport that had availability. Returned to the airport at 6 AM the next morning to fly standby on the 8 AM flight. Did not make it on, but that flight is now delayed. United has reported that they need to “balance the weight of the aircraft”. But the truth is that they overfilled the aircraft with fuel, and need to burn it off before it's safe to fly (explained by a United employee at the departure gate). I'm Still on standby. This has already cost me $100 which I highly doubt I will be reimbursed for. Save yourself the time, money, and emotional turmoil, and do not fly United!!",Negative
Delayed for two days now and still waiting. The worst flight experience I've ever had in my life and they refuse to compensate me back for the ticket. Terrible customer service.

"I only give it 4 stars for several reasons that are specific to iPad users, I believe:1. The top is very slick and easy to use finger gestures, whether deliberately or by accident. It takes some practice to keep your finger(s) floating over the mouse rather than resting on it. It's too easy to move screen objects by accident with accidental finger movement on the mouse. I'm guessing this is more of a problem on an iPad than a Mac, because of the iPad's sensitive touch screen.2. On an iPad, you don't get a slanted arrow mouse pointer like on a Mac. Instead, you get a circle moving on the screen. Where the exact pointer is on an iPad is anyone's guess.3. It's easy to hold the mouse tilted to one side rather than in a straight North to South direction. This impacts how it behaves if you think you're moving the mouse up when in reality you're “up movement” is actually sliding sliding the mouse sideways.Finger gestures on top of the mouse is just one more way to control your iPad. Now I have my choice of using the Home button, the Apple Pencil, the Apple Magic Keyboard, or the Apple Magic Mouse. I bought the mouse for apps that I could not control with the keyboard, the pencil or my third-party mouse.It was maddening having a 3rd party mouse with a scrollwheel, which wouldn't scroll.I know a lot of people are happy using 3rd party accessories on their Macs and iPads. I've had bad experiences with 3rd party keyboards and mice. If they don't work exactly like Apple's, then I feel I've only gotten what I paid for. The extra money I spend on Apple Accessories saves me time and frustration—that makes the added expense worth it, for me.",Positive with Suggestion

Not only did I experience delay after delay - 3.5 hours delay, they have also had to rebook my tickets twice because of this. I've had to fly visa Newark to get back to London. And after a long and painful flight, having returned to London Heathrow, they have lost my two checked luggages! United Airlines baggage enquiry staff told me that one of my luggages was in London and made me wait for four hours looking at carousels from other flights, in the end, I went home with zero luggages. They said my luggages will be delivered the day after, but the contact number they have provided to track your lost luggage does not work, very hard to get ahold of United Airlines customer service. What an absolute nightmare of an experience I have had. Very poor service. I will never fly with United again.",Negative
Flights were late into Newark with United (their fault) do we missed connecting flight to London. No one from United around to help so had to go to baggage services ? Queued for 2 Hrs only got help after complaining it's now 1am with 2 kids. Couldn't provide hotel at airport so agreed we'd be compensated it we booked and paid ourselves. Now won't pay compensation for the hotel. Awful customer service,Negative
"my boyfriend, literally loses his wallet every single day Well lost his wallet every single day until I bought him this AirTag. I got him a wallet with a AirTag slot on it and ever since then he hasn't went a single day without it. It gives him a complete ease of finding it when he sits it down somewhere because his phone alerts him exactly where it has been left. It is super accurate and it has a battery inside that takes years to die so it's definitely durable and worth the purchase. You can put it in your purse. You can put it in your wallet. You can put it in your children's book bag. Whatever you want to keep up with you can place that AirTag on it or in it. Your phone also allows you to play a sound from your AirTag if you lose it and it is loud so you won't miss it.",Positive
"Anyone who has a daughter knows that a Stanley water bottle is the ""it"" container for fluids. This is stylish and the color is beautiful. The handle is convenient for carrying. The style allows for customization with a fun straw color cover. Drinks stay cold for hours. The top does leak. Leaks through straw without separate cover and leaks through the piece that holds the straw. Assembly and disassembly for dishwashing is easy and all pieces are dishwasher safe. Screw top is also very easy to open. Expensive, but in line with name brand metal water bottles. Drinks taste crisp and cold.",Negative with Suggestion

"Often Apple products have a layer of quality, feel, integration, features or ease of use that distinguish them from the competition. This is not true here. While the quality and build are solid- this is a mouse- that at least with respect to the IPad Air M2 is comparable performance wise with products costing less than half.Functionality wise, other than a few gestures that are useful- I found a much less expensive Logitech mouse to be slightly more responsive. While the Logitech mouse uses a scroll wheel- it was no more laggy than the Magic Mouse.On the Mac Air, I have another Logitech mouse, again much less expensive, that meets my needs extremely well.This review is not intended to be a commercial for Logitech- but only to highlight that with respect to the Magic Mouse, the value proposition is not quite there. The build quality of the Magic Mouse is excellent, but the overall performance and ergonomics don't seem to justify the price.",Negative with Suggestion

"If you're worried about the Zombie Apocalypse, this kit is a great way to secure the perimeter of your home- just open the packages of pretty rainbow coloured pieces and toss around the floor! With 790 pieces of pure torture, anyone who has ever stepped on a lego knows this will be a very inexpensive way to keep Zombies, Burglars, Assorted Bad Guys, and any barefooted adults at a safe distance. This is also a super bargain for anyone who loves building with legos, but hates the price of those little kits-- which can cost $15 and up for enough pieces for ONE specific toy build, so ya, bargain.We gave this set to a 9 year old, and unfortunately it was the second gift opened at the party...and mom and dad had to tell him to put the legos down and open the other gifts. He did, but immediately went back to the lego set and *everyone* at the party (all the kids and one of the dads) just spilled them out on a table and began to build things. So yay for me - first time I've brought the best gift!Now, the S I Z E of the bucket (adorable btw) is roughly 14"" x 10"" x 7"" -> which, after you open all the little bags with all the really pretty rainbow coloured pieces and dump them in, will look rather ""wah waaaaaahn"" if you know what I mean. (LOOK at the photo and understand that the rainbow row of pieces is what you are getting - the toys are an *example* of what you can *make* -not additional pieces, so disappointing at first unless you KNOW what you are getting.) But there are seriously 790 pieces in there and the bucket has enough storage space left over that the mom was very HAPPY to go get the other legos they had and dump them in the ""CUTE NEW LEGO BOX!"" (It looks like a giant lego) The kit comes with an instruction booklet for 3 toys to build and a link to online instructions for about 4-5 more toys. I am pretty sure you can go on pinterest and other sites and find all sorts of free patterns, so wahoo for those folks who make things and share freely.BOTTOM LINE: If you need an impressive fun INEXPENSIVE FOR WHAT YOU'RE GETTING gift, this is it.",Positive with Suggestion

There is not really a scent to it which is perfect because scents can irritate the skin.

"The staff of this airline at the terminal,  is probably the most heartless I have ever had the experience of dealing with. My daughter was  traveling alone back to University and was trying very hard to navigate thru the congested security clearance which is another story, en route to the boarding gate. She arrived with boarding ticket in hand (confirmed the day prior)  and 3 minutes to spare before final boarding was done. She was told by the gentleman agent that the door is locked and she has to contact customer service. Another agent tried to intervene on her behalf to no avail, she proceeded to spend the remainder of the day between terminals on standby before a late afternoon flight which then compounded her return to University once at her destination. Very simple, there was still time to board and this was unnecessary stress. Do better United!

"If you have used one of these mice before then you don't really need a review. I'll just say it looks nice in black although it starts looking dirty slightly easier than the white one.If you haven't used this product before, these are some important considerations:a. It's the most Mac-compatible mouse that I know of, it being from the same company. So you'll have access to all the nice gestures and features. That is a huge plus if you're a fan of the MacOS interface.b. Its biggest flaw by far is the charging situation. The charging port is BELOW the mouse, making it physically impossible to charge the mouse WHILE using it. Battery lasts for a long time though, so it might be very rare that you cannot use it because it's charging--just remember to do so while you're away and you'll be good to go.c. As I mentioned, battery life is really good. You can also leave it sleeping without turning it off and nothing bad will happen. I think I charge mine every couple of months, with 3-5 days a week of usage.d. If you want this for gaming, DO NOT BUY, as you have no buttons, scroll wheel, and the sensor is totally tuned for everyday browsing and editing and not for precise movements, and its movement is very assisted (although I'm not sure to what extent that's on MacOS's side).e. About looks, it definitely looks nice both in white and black. Its wireless so it looks nice and elegant.f. On build quality, some units are not on par with the best of Apple's products, but it is still very solid. It definitely doesn't feel cheap although it's definitely pricey for what it does, considering that it hasn't been upgraded in many years.TL;DR: 4/5 stars. Negative: charging port, price.

That is absolutely not the case, no matter what you do, no matter how many hours you spend on Netflix Support, all it will allow you to do is change the household to your second home, which will block Netflix at your main home or you can pay $7.99 to add an additional user.

"I really want to love it because I LOVE some of the touchpad-like functionality. But as many others have said, the ergonomics are really poor. I've considered getting some of the ergonomic accessories/add-ons, but it's also a little heavy, and takes a bit more effort to engage a click than feels healthy. Wish it had tap to click! (I actually tried a third-party app to help with that – but while it added the functionality, it was a bit buggy/jumpy, so I didn't keep using it.)Alas, this little guy is getting returned… Keeping it at 3 stars rather than 2 because for someone who is only a light computer user, it might be okay.

Standard box of Lego bricks.  Decent variety of shapes and sizes.  I'm not such a fan of all the different colors; I would prefer sticking to just a few colors and providing more bricks of those colors.

I found out the hard way by thinking I had a defective one the first time, as it failed to work with my old Mac as well. Why Apple would do this is beyond me, but it's Apple (eye roll). It is hard to find this out on line, and Apple simply states on the box ‘requires Mac with the latest version of macOS', with any specifics.",Negative with Suggestion

"I used to make fun of people for using these Stanley cups, I always thought they were overpriced and over hyped. But I purchased this for my little sister who is in nursing school, and she takes this thing with her everywhere!!! All she does is rave about how amazing it is! So I bought one as well, and they really are amazing products. Made super well, they keep ice in them for hours and hours! Super comfortable to hold in your hand, not too heavy or bulky. Easy to clean and seem to be super durable. I've dropped mine I don't even know how many times now, and not a single mark! They also don't leak easy at all. Unless you're holding it completely upside down, even then it doesn't leak fast. Super happy!",Positive

"I have flown well over a million miles with United and have had 1K status for many years. Before the pandemic I had 120 plus points canceled since there is a 1 year time limit on them. You can use these points to upgrade which rarely happens. I have another 80 points due to be canceled this month and reached out to see if I could extend the expiration to no avail!I traveled over 100K miles last year with United and tried to upgrade using these points but was never able to for whatever reason which is solely in United's control. What is the point of having this so-called benefit, if United controls it and there is an expiration date on it?I do get pre-boarding benefits which is last in a long list of other pre-boarding groups. I do get complimentary economy plus seating which is a smidgen better than economy but for international trips they are not very comfortable either.The ground staff is not very pleasant and crew on the plane treat passengers like cattle compared to other international airlines where service is much better, and quality of the food and entertainment is better.Unfortunately, I am vested and switching gears this late in the game doesn't make sense; if another airline offered to take my status and points and such over I would without hesitation switch and be loyal to them as I have been to United. If you do not have any status with United, does not make much sense to travel with them unless circumstances warrant it.Hope this helps someone.",Negative with Suggestion
Loved these! I had never purchased before because I never taught I'd be necessary for my trip.

I have always used Netflix. But tell me why I can't watch Netflix at my home during the week and at my cabin on the weekends. I'm paying your overpriced fees.

"I'm not too sure whether airline carriers are regulated in the US/EU. I do know that their pricing and grading of tickets is a nightmare. The flight from Dublin to Las Vegas, via (Newark) was delayed by 1 hour. Our travel agent had booked tickets through Lufthansa, one of which was an internal US flight. Our original flights were cancelled, and a new itinerary was issued, this was done over the phone with Lufthansa. We travelled from Dublin, with no luggage, as we wanted to purchase a number of items. When trying to check in baggage with United, we were hit with a $350 charge, because our ticket was BASIC Economy, my partners bag was under 23kg, and she was hit with a $275, while mine was $75. I'm not even sure that a basic economy exists in Europe, as you just pay a fee for bringing on luggage both ways (€50). United airlines in my opinion are rip off merchants. It's shocking a customer has to pay this, this should be highlighted on the first page of their app, but no, it's not,  because their revenue stream is dependent on not being transparent, and ripping people off. A shocking airline, who I will NEVER fly with again!!!!",Negative with Suggestion
"A Love Story of Form Over FunctionThere it sits on my desk, a gleaming slice of minimalist beauty, mocking me with its perfectly curved surface and seamless touch controls. Like a toxic relationship I can't seem to escape, I keep coming back to the Magic Mouse despite knowing better. And yes, I too own multiple, as if collecting them might somehow justify the cognitive dissonance.Let's address the elephant in the room: charging it requires flipping it on its back like a helpless turtle, rendering it temporarily useless. It's perhaps the most infamous example of Apple's occasional triumph of aesthetics over practicality. Yet somehow, this design choice feels almost poetic in its absurdity – a metaphor for our willingness to sacrifice convenience for style.The touch surface is simultaneously brilliant and maddening. Gestures flow like water when they work, letting you swipe between pages with the grace of a digital ballet dancer. But attempt to scroll precisely through a document, and you'll find yourself performing micro-adjustments worthy of a brain surgeon.The ergonomics? Well, if you enjoy gripping a bar of soap made of aluminum and glass, you're in for a treat. The low profile forces your hand into a position that would make an ergonomist weep. Yet here I am, day after day, choosing this sleek rectangle over more comfortable alternatives, like someone who keeps wearing uncomfortable shoes because they look fantastic.Why do we do this to ourselves? Perhaps it's the way it perfectly matches our other Apple devices, creating that satisfying aesthetic harmony on our desks. Or maybe it's Stockholm syndrome, developed over years of Apple ecosystem investment.The Magic Mouse is a testament to our willingness to embrace beautiful imperfection. It's not the best mouse – not by a long shot – but like a painting that's slightly askew that you refuse to straighten, it has become part of your identity. It's a small act of defiance against pure rationality, choosing form over function while being fully aware of the trade-off.And so here we sit, you and I, with our collection of Magic Mice, simultaneously frustrated and captivated by their elegant flaws. At least they look good sitting there while we complain about them.",Negative

"I decided to purchase a Stanley cup and I have made the best choice. They have so many colors, different styles and sizes to choose from.What stands out the MOST is its impressive insulation. It keeps my water ice cold for hours which it can last a day. The handle is sturdy and is a great addition to the cup. The handle makes it easy and super convenient to carry around. I've had zero issues with leaks. I've purchased the little leak proof accessories to aid in cases I accidentally tip it over.The large capacity is a game-changer; I no longer need constant refills. If you're looking for a durable, high-quality tumbler and one that's looks stylish this is the one. I highly recommend this brand. You won't regret your purchase.",Positive

Helps me keep track of my flight risk dogs. Worth the piece of mind. I tried one of the dog tracking devices; it was useless as it never could get cellular service despite paying for a subscription.

"I like this set, its a lot of fun. My daughter and I build everything in the fairly limited guidebook and have moved on to user-created designs on Rebrickable. The only thing that sucks is, the set is missing large bricks. They fit lots of teensy-weensy pieces in to pad out the piece count. It's a bummer.My daughter is still pretty young and unable to play with this set much on her own. On top of the bricks snapping together she has to worry about clips and joints and little onsie-twosie pieces that take a fair amount of motor skill because they demand heavy pressure be applied to a very small surface area.I'm thinking this would be ideal for a 9 year old, but younger kids are going to have difficulty. Just know you won't be using many of the bricks you're buying and that they sell lower brick count sets with more larger pieces.Have fun!",Negative with Suggestion
Surprisingly I'd say United flight attendants are the nicest in the ski now.  They used to be pretty nasty.  It is surprising the number of errors that I get when trying to buy tickets.

I've gone from just the Daily Jay (Jay Shetty) mindfulness lessons to now turning to the Calm app 3 times most days - a mindful start with the Daily Jay, a midday break with one of the work-related meditations or one of the nap programs, and an evening mindfulness check-in.

"I'm writing this review to share my recent travel experience with United Airlines, which unfortunately left me deeply dissatisfied. I had booked a flight from Graz (GRZ) to San Jose (SJO), and to say the least, the journey was filled with a series of unfortunate events that disrupted both my personal and professional commitments.Firstly, I encountered significant disruptions due to frequent rescheduling of my outbound flight. The flight was rescheduled thrice, delaying my departure by two full days. Such frequent changes in schedule demonstrated a lack of coordination and consideration for passengers. While I understand that certain situations may necessitate adjustments, the frequency of these changes was far from acceptable.In addition to this, my return flight was also subject to an unanticipated time change. I was not provided with any prior notification or explanation for this alteration. Being forced to adjust to such changes at the last minute added an unnecessary layer of stress and inconvenience to an already fraught journey.Regrettably, the issues didn't end with scheduling problems. During my journey to San José, United Airlines misplaced my checked baggage, causing a delay of several days before I could retrieve my personal belongings. This was not only unprofessional but also deeply unsettling, as I was left without my belongings for an extended period.To compound these issues, one of my flights experienced an astonishing seven-hour delay. The absence of viable re-accommodation options or any form of compensation during this prolonged delay was, in my opinion, a clear demonstration of poor customer service.As a frequent flyer with United Airlines, I was taken aback by the glaring lack of professionalism and customer care throughout this journey. The series of events, including repeated rescheduling, extensive delays, mishandling of baggage, and poor communication, have severely tainted my perception of the airline.Given the magnitude of these issues, I believe it's imperative that United Airlines conducts a thorough investigation to prevent such incidents in the future. I also hope to see a fair and satisfactory resolution to compensate for the distress and inconvenience caused by these unfortunate incidents.In conclusion, this recent experience has significantly shaken my trust in United Airlines, a company I once regarded for its commitment to excellence and customer satisfaction. I look forward to seeing how they address these concerns and hope that they take necessary steps to improve their service quality for the benefit of all passengers.",Negative with Suggestion

This mouse is heavy duty and does so much more than what an android mouse can do. Im amazed at its functions. Click quality can be managed for you as well as changing to a left click or right click. Best best for my money. Who knew a mouse could do so many things. Works great on my Mac Book Pro. Its weighty not a cheap plastic mouse.

"Ive bought a pair of Torch 4 every year since 2013 I think.  I go through Tennis Shoes quickly.  I love the color scheme of this pair.  However as they get dirty you can really see darker stains.I love the comfort of the Torch 4, especially the sole.  I wear orthotics, and they work great in these shoes.  I do find over time the cushion fades and the support is lost.  This is a big reason I buy new ones yearly.  Plus the sole and fabric wears after heavy use.The only downside really is the length of the laces.  You have to really lace these tight to be able to tie in a bow.I have found these cheaper on sale in stores, but I would buy them again at this price.Update 12/2020: I did in fact buy another pair.  First pair had the material against the heel wear a hole making it uncomfortable.  I wouldnt say they were defective as I wore them for over 4 months almost daily and I wear insoles.  So it was just wear and tear in my opinion.",Positive with Suggestion
"The good movies/series are getting removed. Like Fast &amp; Furious ( Tokyo Drift ) and Fast &amp; Furious. It's okay to remove some shows but you guys need to stop removing the classics and the good ones. When someone watches it people are gonna get hooked too and would wanna watch it for themselves. And they're gonna ask where to watch it. If you say HBO Max or Hulu or something, people might not watch it because they don't have it or can't get it. All they have is Netflix for that matter.

"I've been using the Apple Magic Mouse for a few months now, and I can confidently say it's one of the best mice I've ever had! First off, the design is incredibly sleek and minimalistic, which fits perfectly with my Mac setup. The wireless Bluetooth connection is seamless, and I've had zero issues with lag or disconnection.The multi-touch surface is a game-changer. I love how easy it is to navigate through pages and apps with gestures like swiping and scrolling. It makes using the mouse so much more intuitive and enjoyable, especially when multitasking between different apps and windows.The rechargeable battery is another huge plus. I've only had to charge it a few times, and it lasts for a surprisingly long time. It's so much more convenient than dealing with disposable batteries.Overall, the Magic Mouse is smooth, responsive, and looks great on my desk.

"you know ive got to say this i purchased Perry Marshals book a year or so ago and got bogged down with it all.  Your course was worth more than his book particularly the walk through examples and just being able to think, oh this will work with that, and if i do that x should be the result. When i started in business back in 2001 i was lucky enough to get adwords working in my favour before everyone else jumped on the band waggon.  Now its a different game completely but i can see by your course all my original mistakes and even current ones. What is funny though, is that i didnt realise about remarketing and now understand why those annoying images would re-appear about a company or business i looked at earlier in the week, now at least i know what they are doing and why.",Positive

"I was able to get a one year Premium subscription for super cheap with a special deal. After using it for a few days, the meditations are fine. What I find super frustrating is there is NO way to easily filter and search for meditations. For example, in another FREE app, I can filter by time, male vs female voice, key word (e.g. binaural), with or without music, even preview the voice. With Calm, there is no way to do that. You can only pick a category, like sleep or mediation. I prefer sleep meditations with music, but I have to literally play at least 30 seconds of each and every one or ff to see if it has it. I've already canceled my subscription to ensure it won't renew next year because not at all worth full price at $70 when other apps for way less or free have better navigation and functionality.",Negative with Suggestion

Well, I supplied them with my email address thinking I had to in order to make my PAID app work. Then the app told me to login with the Apple ID with which I bought the membership.  Umm… I only have one Apple ID.  The one I am using.  No matter what I did, I couldn't get it to give me the access I paid for.

Aaaannnnd they immediately started spamming me.  I clicked on unsubscribe immediately without reading their idiotic sales pitch that I never wanted in the first place. I hate that crap.

After My flight got delay I had to spend a night in Chicago and fly the following day. United offered no hotel or food though the delay was almost a full day (to the following day). My flight which I then was booked to didn't have the same class available so they also downgraded my ticket. Later when I contacted them to get some of my money for food hotel and a premium economy ticket which I never got back they offered my a lousy 150$ voucher. My own expenses was beyond 400$ and they deny paying me back the premium economy ticket which they were unable to deliver. Worst airline ever - they are always delayed and really don't care about their costumers..,Negative

All of my flights were delayed (one was because they had no crew), and apparently there is no in-flight entertainment offered anymore on United flights. There was no food offered other than a small bag of pretzels and a cup of water for a cross-country (5+ hour) flight, I was forced to pay $10 for Wi-Fi service that didn't work, and now I've been told United apparently have a new policy in which they don't adjust fares for bereavement travel. When I called customer service, I was forced into using the text messaging option to try to resolve my concerns due to the waiting period to speak to a representative being over 90 minutes. The United representative that I texted with was not only not helpful, but their messages were full of poor grammar, no punctuation (they often wrote paragraphs with no commas or periods or anything...it was just a run-on, nonsensical way of communicating), and a complete lack of willingness to resolve my concern(s). United has lost a customer for life.",Negative
We booked flights from Edinburgh to Newark leaving on 16 May returning from Nashville to Edinburgh on 16 June as part of a special trip to celebrate our 50th wedding anniversary. The flight going out was delayed for hours! We were left sitting on the plane and they stopped people getting on the flight. They then started asking for passengers to give up their seats. They had obviously overbooked the flight and it was just chaos. Eventually we took off but were told as the plane was heavier than it should be it would take longer to get to Newark. As a nervous flier this was a bit worrying! Great start to our holiday! When we tried to check in for our return flight on 14 June we couldn't find our booking on their website albeit we had confirmation from when we booked several months earlier. It was impossible to get through on the telephone to speak with anyone so we had to get a taxi to the airport to try and sort this out. United do not have a customer service desk so the only way we could speak with someone was to stand in the check in queue for an hour. When we explained we had booked flights for the next day but were unable to find our booking the female assistant just took our paperwork and started looking on the computer. She didn't say one word to us! After twenty minutes she handed us a piece of paper which indicated we were back on the flight but with no booked seats (we had our seats booked originally). There was no reason given as to why this had happened and no apology. We had to get a taxi back to our accommodation and spent the next couple of hours trying to get our seats sorted out. This was the last day of our holiday and it was completely ruined by their inefficiency. It was such a stressful day and caused a lot of upset. I contacted United complaints on our return and eventually received an apology but no reason for what had happened or offer of compensation. When I asked again why we had been removed from this flight they completely ignored me. How do they manage to get away with this atrocious service?!? Could never recommend them and won't use them again.,Negative

Simply put the extremely unprofessional handling, lack of experience/training, or just flat out in the wrong department, but working with Ashley in customer service at Phila airport was not next to impossible, flat out impossible. United must provide either better screening for employees or better training especially for a customer service rep on how to handle….maybe….customers!!!  As a business owner myself I would want to know if my employees conducted business in such a unprofessional detrimental manner in which Ashley clearly demonstrated, thus I am passing this along to united management and any other customer that may find themselves in the customer service office at phila int airport, and trying to express concerns with the Ashley on the other side of the counter.

"I flew with United Airlines in December of 2022. They forced me to gate check my carry on bag. The flight was ultimately cancelled, but they did not give people back the gate checked luggage. Subsequently, they lost the bag, which is common for United Airlines. I filed a claim end of December 2022. In January/February time, when I followed up with my claim, they lied to me saying that the bag had been found and returned to me. Which it had not. Once I got that cleared up, they confirmed that I would get reimbursed for the cost of my lost items. This was meant to be paid in May - which it did not. I have been chasing since. I finally called them today, and again, they lied saying that the money should have gone into my account in July. Which, I have proof that it did not. Losing bags is one thing, the constant lying and over 8 months to get my reimbursement is unacceptable.",Negative

She refused and United instead took everyone off the plane instead. They eventually canceled the flight 5 hours later.

"Shocking experience with United Airlines, who left our family including 2 elderly people and an infant stranded in Boston over the Boston Marathon weekend for 2 days. We incurred over $1,000 in extra hotel and food costs, and United refused to compensate us even one cent in violation of Canada's Air Passenger Protection Regulations!On the morning of our scheduled departure, United told us the Boston-Newark leg of our journey (United 523) was delayed because of an earlier delay impacting our plane's arrival, meaning we would not have sufficient time to make our Newark-Calgary connection. United further confirmed that the reason for the earlier delay was boarding of the aircraft taking longer than expected, which is within the airline's control. Due to the delay, United asked us to either re-book on a different United flight or get a refund.We spent over 2.5 hours on the phone with United trying to find an alternative flight, but were told that the earliest available alternative was not for another 2 days, even though we showed great flexibility e.g. we were willing to connect via a different city, split our family up so we flew on different airplanes, and / or accept a longer connection time. Despite this, United said there was absolutely no option for us to fly for another 2 days.We looked ourselves into flying with another airline, but the cost of such last-minute tickets was thousands of dollars per passenger and therefore prohibitively expensive. This meant cancelling our United flights and getting a refund was not a feasible solution. We note that United did NOT offer us the option of arranging a flight with a different airline carrier without additional expense, which is contrary to our rights under Canada's Air Passenger Protection Regulations (APPR). We therefore accepted the new United itinerary.We were shocked that a leading international airline like United was not able to reschedule us for two full days. Our family includes two elderly people and a 4 month old infant travelling long distance for the first time in his young life. My wife has debilitating back and gastrointestinal issues and was forced to suffer a further two nights in a foreign country and hotel, rather than having the comforts of her own home and medical care. Our destination city of Calgary is not a small town - it has a population of 1.45 million people and a very active international airport. We were stuck in Boston during the very busy Boston Marathon weekend, which forced us to stay at an expensive hotel 2 more nights than we planned as we could not find last minute accommodation elsewhere (as you can imagine, it is even more difficult to find a hotel room that works for an infant and an elderly person with back problems). We also incurred additional meal costs and transportation costs to the airport.Our total additional expenses amounted to USD 1,110.We filed a formal complaint with United and requested compensation for this under the APPR legislation. It took United close to 2 months to reply, and they refused to provide any compensation whatsoever (vaguely blaming the weather, which was the first time we heard this excuse!), which is in violation of the APPR. We are now filing a formal legal complaint with the Canadian Transportation Agency but also wanted to write a review to make the public aware. All airlines have their issues, but this is a new low given our vulnerability",Negative

"I don't want to sound entitled or anything you know I love netflix, however the pricing netflix offers now is truly absurd for what little shows and movies we get. i understand that other services take the rights to certain films and series so they have no choice but the pricing is ridiculous majority of peoples favorite shows are gone or are yet to leave soon anyway why not lower pricing. 

Also I do have one request will netflix ever offer custom profiles been wanting it from quite sometime since hbo does it. since perhaps you're going to charge people an arm or leg for this app and for “cheaper” pricing you lock half of the films and give ads. and the fact that people get charged for sharing passwords is just.. whew

least you can do is offer some new features or something yk atleast with other services they offer discounts and addons you'll get that for way cheaper than netflix offers.

But bless you all in the future!💗",Negative with Suggestion

On April 22 after checking in for my flight I was trying to go through tsa and was told my id and name on boarding pass don't match. I was told to go back to united counter and have my pass changed. The manager told me I needed to call American express because I book through them. I was on the phone in the airport for two hours with American express who was on the phone the whole time with United. Neither could change my ticket. At this point I was frantic and went back to the counter and said I have to get home what can I do. The manager said I had to buy a whole new ticket by that time I had to purchase a later flight. Nothing worse then feeling like you are going to be stranded somewhere,Negative

"Am 08.09.22 bin ich zusammen mit meiner Frau mit dem Flug UA031 von München nach Newark (New York) geflogen um eine Kreuzfahrt anzutreten. Es gab keine Möglichkeit vorab online den Check-in durchzuführen. Beim Check-in am Flughafen waren die Plätze bereits zugeteilt und wir wurden nicht nebeneinander gesetzt. Eine Änderung war nicht möglich. Beim Rückflug am 22.09.22, UA030 dann die gleiche Situation. Die Plätze waren willkürlich in der Maschine verteilt. Eine Änderung wäre zwar möglich gewesen, jedoch gegen Zuzahlung von 44 Euro. Das empfinde ich als Frechheit! So einen schlechten Service habe ich bisher bei keiner anderen Airline erlebt. Beim Check-in erwarte ich schlichtweg, dass ich zwei Sitzplätze nebeneinander auswählen kann. Von diesem Chaos war übrigens die ganze Reisegruppe betroffen. Ich werde in Zukunft andere Airlines bevorzugen.",Negative with Suggestion

"I'd never recommend flying with United. My most recent experience includes working with a United Agent to cancel a leg of my flight itinerary where I received explicit confirmation from them that I would receive a full refund on that leg of the flight. The disclaimer is that I would have to submit the official refund after I finished the return leg of my flight 10 days later. That's fine and I went forward with things. Fast forward to today where it has been 3 weeks since submitting the official refund request with screenshots of my previous conversation with the United agent...they denied my refund request and instead gave me a $150 credit, which is 25% of the value that I was promised. So highly disappointed knowing that United is okay with lying to customers. I would never have cancelled my flight had I known that I wasn't going to get reimbursed.",Negative
"10/6/23 UA85 was delayed in Orlando due to fuelling and bad weather. In Newark we were held longer on the plane, I missed flight UA90 to TLV by 7 minutes. Other flights gotten cancelled by UA, So the lines of people needing services were ridiculous, as well as the hostile environment created by United airlines employees who were brought from other departments to serve as “customer service”. UA ran out of hotel vouchers. 6/11/23 UA84 was successful. I however missed my medical procedure, $1000 I paid towards, and therefore the whole purpose of my trip. I also lost my reserved seats in favour of an isle middle seat. 6/28/23 UA85 was an hour delayed due to cleaning. I couldn't lay back my seat and suffered from chair kicking throughout the flight. UA1402 was canceled due to unexpected operational issue. I put myself on standby for UA1695 and lost due to another delay and a jammed carousel. I had to cancel all my 6/29/23 patients while facing the unending lines, desperate calls for assistance from unprofessional UA system and employees who seem to get worse. United airlines phone representatives are being recorded thus possibly more helpful to put me on a flight that a guy from customer service -Newark (David s.) refused to locate and put me on. He said without looking in his computers that there aren't flights to Florida the next 4 days, also he doesn't have to provide me this service. All of his colleagues made me feel invisible and were ignoring me due my justified doubt and frustration (Despite being polite). 6/29/23 UA735 left 10 minutes late and 1 change of gate, an error code with my ticket wouldn't allow me to print a label after checked in online. UA2636 departed as expected. I reserved seats to avoid risks and get back on time to pick up my children (single mom here). there were available seats on both flights. Taking the loss and damages I have suffered into account, I am kindly requesting United airlines to refund all my airfare expenses of  $1737.87",Negative

"We traveled from Copenhagen to Dallas in mid-December and our bags were lost; we eventually got our bags back 6 days later. But we had to purchase clothing, winter coats, toiletries, etc that amounted o over $1200 between the two of us. I submitted the claim in early January and was told we would receive the reimbursement within 30-60 business days. Nothing came until late May (1.5 months late) AND they made an error. We only received $180 because United didn't transfer the correct currency to my Danish account. I emailed United right away and was told the remaining balance would be transferred, give it 2-3 more weeks. Nothing came.July comes. I've called muliple United agents. Each time I spend 30+ minutes on the phone going back through everything, explaining how I was sent the wrong amount. My case was escalated by a manager in August; nothing happened. My case was excalated in September; nothing happened. I'm given the run-around, promised updates via email and phone calls, of course, no transfer happened.It's October 9, 10 months later, and once again I am on the phone with an agent (40 minutes this ime) arguing for the money owed and promised. The latest lie is that since an agent offered me a $300 United voucher for the incredibily long processing time, my case is closed because I ""settled"" for the voucher. Who in their right mind would settle for a voucher that's 1/4 the amount rightfully owed them? I don't plan to fly United ever again; give me a voucher, don't give me a voucher... I don't care. Your customer service is appauling and I deserve the money owed to me.We had to spend a lot of money on things we didn't plan for just before Christmas. Plus the stress of shopping for essentials, tracking our suitcases, wondering if the gifts we brought from Denmark would make it in time or at all. How can you treat your customers like this? You have the money and resources; you need to do better.",Negative

So disapponinted with them. I don't wantanyboday to experience this, so If you 're flying your parents with united I recommend NOT to do that. Initial flight: UA3631They moved them to these flights with additional layover: UA1176, UA 586",Negative

I brought this to work and the same morning a coworker commented how she liked it. The color is amazing (I got ' indigo').  I particularly like 2 things about these Stanley mugs over other mugs.  One is the top screws on unlike other brands that just push on.  That's important to me if I tip it I know the top will stay on.  Also I drink HOT tea and the top allows a bit to come out and cool on its way to my lips. Other brands you tilt it and WHAM your lips get scalding water without warning. This top is designed well so that doesn't happen.  Overall I'm a fan of the 20oz tumblers without the handles.  Not sure why anyone needs a handle because the mug is cool to the touch no matter how hot the insides are.  Just sayin',Positive
Very informative and I learned a lot of new things! Hopefully this will translate well into my campaings,Positive
"The LEGO Classic Large Creative Brick Box 10698 is a fantastic set that encourages hours of creative play! With such a wide variety of bricks in different shapes, sizes, and colors, the possibilities for building are truly endless. My kids love designing everything from cars to houses to abstract creations, and it's amazing to see their imaginations come to life.The included storage box is a lifesaver—sturdy, spacious, and perfect for keeping everything organized. It's great for both home and classroom use, offering an interactive and educational activity for kids of all ages.LEGO has once again proven why they're the gold standard for building toys. This set is perfect for fostering creativity, problem-solving, and fine motor skills. Highly recommend it for boys, girls, and even adults who want to join in on the fun!",Positive

"Reduced a star, Magic Trackpad battery life has been barely lasting 2 weeks, turned off several gestures and will have to see if there are improvements. If abttery life lasts 1 month, that's reasonable, but 1-2 weeks of battery draining so much is a bit excessive. Will update again after a month.Reasons to get a Magic Mouse (USB-C) over the Magic Trackpad (USB-C)• Greater precision when selecting specific points• Greater accuracy when clicking, holding, and dragging (for highlighting text, or signing a signature)• Cheaper price $99 (on sale for $80 black friday/ holidays) vs $149 (no sale was seen)• Cleaner desk layout when paired with a magic keyboard and having the macbook on a stand• Better battery lifeReason to get a Magic Trackpad (USB-C) over the Magic Mouse (USB-C):• Larger surface area, greater range of movement/ motion without physically moving hand• Many gestures and better usage of gestures compared to magic mouse (such as two finger zoom, on the mouse you can only double tap to zoom and it is limited as it zooms for you rather than you choosing how much to zoom yourself)• Can charge the trackpad while still using it• Great to use for creative programs such as Photoshop, Illustrator, Premiere Pro, and the likes (being able to use your finger for tools such as brush, pencil, pen, ... is much easier to use, drawing with finger is somewhat equivalent to drawing with a pencil)Regardless of whichever device you choose to purchase, go to your system settings by clicking the apple logo at the top left of your screen, go to bluetooth, click info (i in a circle) on either the magic trackpad/ mouse, then click trackpad/ mouse settings. Here you will be able to customize the gestures and movement to your liking.TLDR: If you are a creative I recommend the trackpad for greater range of movement/ expression (especially if macbook is elevated on a stand), if you want a clean desk layout the magic mouse is a nice addition to the built-in macbook trackpad.However if you're not looking to stay in the apple ecosystem, there are better mouse options out there.It's nice to finally have usb-c across many apple products. Main reason I stopped using some products was because having a lightning cable was just inconvenient.",Negative with Suggestion

"I've been using the Apple Mouse for several weeks now, and I'm thoroughly impressed with its performance and design. The sleek, minimalist look fits perfectly with my Apple setup, and it feels incredibly solid and premium in hand. The smooth, responsive surface makes scrolling through documents and websites a breeze, and the multi-touch capabilities for gestures are intuitive and work flawlessly. I especially love the ability to swipe between pages and switch apps with a simple gesture—it's a real productivity booster.The comfort is surprisingly good too. While it's low-profile, the design fits my hand well and doesn't cause discomfort even after long hours of use, which was a concern for me at first. The precision is excellent for both everyday tasks and more detailed work like photo editing.One minor downside is that the charging method via Lightning cable can be a bit inconvenient, as you can't use it while charging. However, the battery life lasts a long time between charges, so it's not something I have to worry about frequently.Overall, the Apple Mouse offers an excellent balance of style, functionality, and ease of use, and it's a great addition to any Apple user's workspace. It's well worth the investment if you're looking for a reliable, high-quality mouse.",Positive with Suggestion

This gentle cleanser not only effectively removes dirt and impurities, but it also leaves out little ones skin feeling incredibly soft and hydrated. The formula is infused with natural oat extract, which soothes my skin and helps maintain its moisture balance.

Overall, it's a fantastic product that I highly recommend for anyone looking to nourish their little ones skin while cleansing.",Positive

"If I could give zero stars, I would. This company has the worst customer service I have ever experienced. I payed for a flight, changed it, got a 'flight credit' for 2,500 USD. I needed to change a different flight du to an emergency and the fare difference was pretty much the same and some change (plus 90 USD). WELL, APPARENTLY TO USE THE CREDIT, THE FLIGHT DIFFERENCE NEEDS TO BE EXACT OR GREATER. They wouldn't make an exception for 90 USD  for me to use my credit. I spoke to a supervisor. No possibility, no nothing. SO I ate it and payed the additional fee. Absolute robbery. Companies like United deserve to lose all of their customer loyalty, we need better options that cater to customers.",Negative with Suggestion
I think you should have more options for people who can afford your app. Anxiety and mental health is a real thing! I would love using the app if there more options then me having to pay for. Most people who having mental health don't have the option or the means to pay for little things like this that could help more than you could image. Start sponsoring ads and have us watch some ads to unlock some features (like most apps do) stop trying to earn money off of people's mental health problems!,Negative with Suggestion

"I love love this Stanley. This is my 3rd one and my favorite one! Pink is my favorite color. I can't say much about keeping drinks hot because I only use it for water. I only drink water with water packets. But I can say it keeps it cold. I'd recommend using extra ice though. If you don't put enough in, it will melt quickly.

"I recently bought me and my siblings matching Stanley Quencher H2.0 Tumblers (30 oz) in Lilac, and I'm loving it! The tumbler is super cute and not too heavy, making it comfortable to carry around. One of the best things about it is that it keeps your liquid at whatever temperature you put it in, whether it's cold or hot. I love that the ice lasts for a long time inside, which is a huge plus!I don't use mine as much, but my sister lives for hers—she carries it around 24/7. The 3-way twist-on lid is convenient, and the design is cupholder compatible, making it perfect for on-the-go. Plus, it's BPA-free and made with insulated stainless steel, so it's super durable.",Positive
"I'm a big fan of this baby body wash. I've been using it since my kid was born. I wanted to find a soap that was safe and gentle for babies with sensitive skin and I generally trust the Aveeno brand and the ingredients in their products.

"My flight with United Airlines was from Washington DC to Buffalo NY.I am so disappointed on how my return flight on the 9th of September 19.59pm  was cancelled last minute.This was a special trip to visit the Niagara Falls for my wife's birthday which ended up being horrible.I would like to start off with saying how I have heard very good feedback about United Airline which is why I decided to book this airline as a birthday present for my wife, however I am very disappointed with my experience and the service I received.My flight was cancelled at the airport after waiting at the airport for over 3 hours which no prior notice and I was not given any support or guidance from any of your ground staff members at the airport. This made my journey extremely more stressful as I was a complete stranger and a tourist. This was my very first time visiting Buffalo NY. I only came to Buffalo NY to visit the Niagara Falls with a stay for only one night and this cancellation has made my journey very stressful and has really impacted me and my wife's mental health. I am over the age of 50 and this put me under a lot of pressure and stress which increased my heart beat quite a lot, I however kept my courage as I needed to go home to my kids. We were forced to take a cab back to our destination which was very expensive as it cost me $730. I had no other option as I had my flight going back to the United Kingdom the very next day from Washington Dulles to London Gatwick on the 10th September 2023. I could not miss this flight as I was going back home as I had left my kids back home. This was a very scary experience for me as it was midnight, and as a tourist we had no idea of even how to book a taxi in a foreign country, to make matters worse I also did not have any internet connection and your staff members were also not supportive in helping us at all.To conclude, this resulted in us not enjoying our last day of our holiday or being able to any of the activities we originally planned. This has also affected my mental health and caused a lot of anxiety for myself and my wife as we were stranded at the airport at mid night with no where to go or any support from your staff members. We were not provided with a hotel or any other means of transportation or flights to take us back to our destination. I also did inform your ground staff of my return flight to the united kingdom, they however still not support me and ignored my request to receive help.Please kindly review this and advise on available compensation as we honestly have had a terrible experience on such a joyous moment in our life.I am also not going to recommend your airline to anyone going forward due to my experience.I want to mention I still have not yet received a refund for my cancelled flight, this was something that was promised to us from your ground staff. They informed me that I would automatically receive a full refund.",Negative

"My son is ADHD and ODD. He struggles with focus and following directions / listening to anyone speaking with authority.Legos have been a major tool we have used to teach following directions in a non-abrasive way. They also allow him to not only follow directions and feel proud of what he accomplished but the opportunities are endless. He can build something specific or create something new.He cannot and will not sit still for ANYTHING else, but Legos keep him occupied long enough for me to actually get things done while also helping him learn and use his imagination.The cute container is also a plus. We have these on display all over his Lego themed playroom and he is even doing them with his little brother now. We keep adding new colors and sets to the collection. Some stay built on display, others get built over and over again. Great for all ages (after they stop putting everything in their mouth, the pieces are definitely a choking hazard)",Positive
"Dear United Airlines,This is what I wrote to United without a response from them. Gave them a second shot and our plane was delayed for 6 hours we were forced to get another airlines flight home and they didn't pay until I complaine they gave me a $200.00 credit for an $1100.00 round trip telling me the flight home was cheaper. Lies!!!!I am writing to express my disappointment as a first-time flyer with your airline. I recently sent a complaint letter regarding my experience and received a reply, but unfortunately, it did not fully address my concerns.My first impression of United Airlines was not a positive one. Despite arriving at the airport well ahead of my flight, I encountered long lines and inefficiency at the check-in counter. The process was confusing, and the staff seemed uninterested in assisting me. This was a significant letdown as I was excited to take my first flight with United Airlines.Additionally, during my flight, I experienced several issues, such as cramped seating, subpar in-flight entertainment, and delayed service. The lack of comfort and convenience made my experience less than desirable.I understand that some of these issues may be beyond your control, but as a customer, I expect a high level of service and comfort. The fact that my experience was not up to par was particularly disappointing as I had high expectations for United Airlines.I would like to request that my concerns be taken seriously and addressed in a timely and satisfactory manner. As a first-time flyer, my experience will impact my future travel decisions, and I hope that United Airlines can take the necessary steps to improve the customer experience.Thank you for your time and consideration.

"After seeing a heartbreaking Facebook post about a lost dog in my area that looked exactly like mine, I had a wake-up call. Even though my dogs are microchipped, I realized that wouldn't help me find them in real-time if they ever got loose. That's when I decided to get AirTags for their collars, and I'm so glad I did.Setup was incredibly easy—literally just a few taps on my phone, and they were ready to go. The best part? I can share their location with family members, so we all have access in case of an emergency. It gives me so much peace of mind knowing that if my dogs ever wander off, I can track them down quickly instead of relying on lost posters and hoping for the best.If you have a pet, I highly recommend getting an AirTag. It's a small investment for a huge sense of security.",Positive

The size is perfect for helping me quickly drink my 1 gallon of water a day. I like that the cup has the no slip grip on the handle which makes it easier and comfortable to carry all the places I carry it. It's very satisfying for me to take the cup apart once a week to deep clean it and it's very easy to take apart clean it and put it back together. I even purchased a cute star shaped ice tray for the cup. I came in perfect condition even though Amazon ships then without a box mine for here unscathed, and I dropped it once and nothing happened no dent and no paint chipped off nothing. They are highly customizable and I already know what the next color I want to order. I can say that the cup can get heavy when filled with water and ice but it's not unbearable.

Hey there is something wrong with this appl it's no longer allowing you to forward rewind or pause when using this on Apple TV. What ends up happening is loss of volume and sound and you have to restart show all over again from beginning so you have to end up watching it multiple times to see parts where you missed a scene because you can no longer pause or go back.
